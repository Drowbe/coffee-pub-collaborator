// A message is posted here, kept (see server/chat-history.js for what is kept and for how long) and told live on the
// live stream (tellChat), so whoever is in the space sees it at once and someone who comes later reads what was said. Only a space has a chat: an aside is not
// a space (plan-names step 8), so its id answers 404 here, reading or posting. Reading needs the "open and read the chat" permission, posting "send chat messages", and the person
// must be in the space (or an owner, or a guest of that space).
// The rule itself, apart from answering: { who, space }, or { status, error }. The live stream asks it again at every
// chat event and while it is open, so a guest link turned off or regenerated, a session that no longer reads (expired, the
// account gone or its password or second step changed) or a person taken out of the space ends the stream. Signing
// out does not: it only clears the cookie in the browser, and an open stream already sent its session, so the page that
// signs out closes its own stream by leaving, and the browser's other open tabs keep theirs until they are closed.
// `permission` left out asks only whether they are in the space (the live stream: being there is the test).

// --- module live messages (plan-module-live.md) ----------------------------------------------------------------------
// Short live messages between the people using one module in one space (a pointer, a typing mark, a nudge). They travel
// over this server only: a POST to send, GET /api/modules/stream to receive. Nothing here asks the call, needs it set up
// or needs anyone on it, and nothing is stored, written to disk or replayed: server/module-live.js keeps, per environment
// and in memory, who has a module stream open in which space, who joined which module's live messages there, the rates
// and the sequence numbers. tools/check-module-live.mjs reads this section and fails if it names the call.
//
// The limits (environment variables; anything but a whole number above 0 is the default):
//   MODULE_LIVE_BYTES (256): the most a message's `data` may be, as JSON.
//   MODULE_LIVE_PER_SECOND (20): messages a second for one person in one module, with a burst of the same.
//   MODULE_LIVE_PER_PERSON (40): messages a second for one person across all modules.
//   MODULE_LIVE_PER_GUEST_LINK (60): messages a second for everyone on one guest link together.
//   MODULE_LIVE_TO (20): the most people one message may name in `to`.
//   MODULE_LIVE_MAX_BYTES (4096), MODULE_LIVE_MAX_PER_SECOND (40): the most any module's size and rate may be; a module
//     that asks for more (`live.bytes`, `live.perSecond`) gets these (it is not refused), and a module that asks for
//     nothing gets MODULE_LIVE_BYTES and MODULE_LIVE_PER_SECOND kept to these too (effective = min(asked or default,
//     maximum)). The maxima themselves are capped at 65536 and 200 whatever the environment says. effectiveLiveLimits
//     (server/module-live.js) works out one module's numbers for the send, the rate and the join answer alike. The two
//     per-person caps and `to` stay the server's.
//   MODULE_LIVE_SPACE_BYTES_PER_SECOND (262144): the data bytes a second (JSON, as counted for the size check) all
//     modules and people together may send in one space, with a burst of the same; over it a send is 429 with Retry-After.
//     A send is taken against it in the same all-or-nothing step as the per-person rates (after the size check), so a send
//     refused by any of them takes from none; a join is not counted.
// Joining counts as a message under the first two (and, for a guest, the third).
//
// Guests (plan-module-live.md, step 3). A guest is known by the id on their guest pass (POST /api/guest-join), as on GET
// /api/live: the module stream, and each send, join and leave, carry it as ?guest=<link>&pass=<pass>. The pass is signed
// with the environment and that link, so it is refused for another link, space or environment, and dies with the link. A
// guest stream without a valid pass still receives (as before), but nobody can name it in `to` and it can't join; a send,
// join or leave without one is 403. The checks are otherwise a person's: the module visible to guests in that space, its
// guards, its read permission and its `publish` permission, from the guest role.
//
// Events on GET /api/modules/stream?space=<id> (a stream with a space; each `event:` named, data JSON):
//   ready   { stream }: first, once. `stream` names this connection to join and leave.
//   live    { module, topic, data, from: { key, name, guest }, at, seq, spaceId }: a message, to every connection in that
//           space whose reader may read the module there now, never the sender's own, and for `to` only those people's.
//           `at` is the server's time (ms) and `seq` counts up per module and space.
//   joined  { module, spaceId, person: { key, name, guest }, people: [...] }: someone joined that module's live messages
//           there; `people` is everyone joined now. To the other readers.
//   left    { module, spaceId, person, people }: someone left (a leave, access lost, or their stream closed and did not
//           come back within the grace, 10 seconds).
