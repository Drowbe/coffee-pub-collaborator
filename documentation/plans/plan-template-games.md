# Games Template Plan

**Audience:** Thomas, who decides what the gaming template sets; server-development builds the template file and the seed; experience-design uses both for the games page.

**Status:** drafted 2026-10-21 by product-planner; Thomas answered two rounds the same day (see Decisions); nothing built. It is step 6 of [plan-product-pages](plan-product-pages.md) (decision 13: the template is made first, then the games page). Sibling of GitHub #351, the project and mentoring template. Three items were proposed as recommended and Thomas has **not yet answered** them; they are marked **proposed, to confirm** and listed under "What is not decided". The template file can be built now with those values (see "Left to build").

## What it is today

- **One bundled template,** `templates/travel.json` (version 7). It is the model: `words`, `icons.home`, `moduleNames`, `modules`, `settings`, `lobby`, `phases` and `spaceDefaults`, with the rules in [plan-environment-templates](plan-environment-templates.md).
- **No gaming material exists.** A search of `templates/`, `server/`, `public/` and `documentation/` finds only the product page's copy ("a space per campaign, side conversations for whispers, the calendar for session nights"), a user guide example of a home word ("Campaigns"), a "game master" and "players" example in the Words guide, and a check case using "Campaigns" (`tools/check-templates.mjs`). No template, no seed, no phases.
- **The home word follows the space word.** With no `home` word of its own, a space word of "campaign" gives "Campaigns" (`server/words.js`, `homeDefault()`). A template only needs a `home` entry to differ from that.
- **Bundled modules that exist** (`modules/`): Planner (`travel`), Places, Maps, Research, Calendar, Polls, To-do, Budget, Assistant and Stream. Stream installs itself in every environment. There is no Notes module: Research is where notes live.
- **A space's default profile is `roleplaying`,** which offers both the Participant and the Character pictures for OBS. That already fits a game; the template needs to set nothing.
- **Phases** (`phases` in a template) are read by the Planner and the journey bar and the countdown chip: a dated, ordered list with one main phase. They were made for a trip. The Planner works without them.
- **The shots seed** (`tools/shots-seed.mjs`) builds the travel environment for the product page screenshots, on a fixed day, 2026-10-15 (a Thursday).

## Decisions

Thomas's, 2026-10-21.

1. **Template name:** "Games" (`"name": "Games"`), matching the page and the sign-up choice. Description to use: "Run a campaign together: the chat, the calendar for sessions, a campaign planner, quests, lore and polls, and every player as an OBS source."
2. **Space word:** "Campaign" (earlier, [plan-product-pages](plan-product-pages.md) decision 15). The home word follows it and reads "Campaigns".
3. **Environment word:** group / groups. The environment is what people sign in to: the gaming group.
4. **Moderator word stays "moderator".** No "co-GM": the template sets no `moderator` word.
5. **Themed module names:** Calendar is shown as **Sessions**, To-do as **Quests**, Research as **Lore**.
6. **The Planner is turned on for the games template.** Thomas chose this, against the earlier recommendation to leave it for #307. It no longer waits on #307.
7. **Places and Maps are off but offered:** not in the template's modules, so an owner can turn them on.
8. **No phases.** The Planner does not need them (see "Phases"). Thomas, 2026-10-21.
9. **The Lobby:** name **Common room**, description **Everyone in every campaign.**
10. **Home icon:** `dice-d20`.
11. **One extra OBS-view shot in the seed,** with the players' Character pictures.
12. **The Planner's themed name is "Campaign planner"** (`moduleNames`). Thomas, 2026-10-21.
13. **The Planner's icon is `scroll`,** set through `moduleIcons`. Thomas, 2026-10-21.
14. **The Planner's travel wording is accepted for now.** The add menu and the Roles tab keep "trip", "stay" and "travel" in a game. The games page claims only the timeline ("The honest claim for the page"). A game-shaped Planner, or #307, is a later change to the module with its own plan. Thomas, 2026-10-21.

### Proposed, to confirm

Recommended in the first draft and **not yet answered** by Thomas. They stay suggestions until he confirms them.

- **The remaining words (proposed, to confirm):** `owner` game master, `aside` whisper, `member` player, `guest` guest, and `canvas`, `module`, `object` left as they are.
- **A new campaign opens with the chat and Sessions (proposed, to confirm):** `spaceDefaults.opensWith: ["chat", "calendar"]`.
- **`showMap` off (proposed, to confirm).**

## The proposal

All of this is a suggestion until Thomas decides it, except what is under Decisions.

### The words

| Key | One / many | State |
|---|---|---|
| `space` | campaign / campaigns | Decided |
| `home` | none: it follows the space word and reads "Campaigns" | Decided with the space word |
| `environment` | group / groups | Decided |
| `moderator` | none: stays "moderator" | Decided |
| `aside` | whisper / whispers | Proposed, to confirm: a private side conversation; the product page already calls them whispers. |
| `owner` | game master / game masters | Proposed, to confirm: the person who runs the group. |
| `member` | player / players | Proposed, to confirm |
| `guest` | guest / guests, left as it is | Proposed, to confirm |
| `canvas`, `module`, `object` | left as they are | Proposed, to confirm: "module" and "canvas" read fine; an `object` here is a quest, a note or a session, so no one word is better. |

Nothing in the template may use the old words listed in CLAUDE.md (Names); `check-names` fences "tavern" as a past product name, so the Lobby cannot be called the Tavern.

### The Lobby and the home icon

Decided: the Lobby is **Common room**, "Everyone in every campaign."; the home icon is `dice-d20` (a Font Awesome Free solid icon).

### Modules on by default

Claimed only from what ships. Everything listed is in `modules/` today. The template's `modules` list would be `travel`, `calendar`, `polls`, `todo`, `research`, `chat`, `conference`.

| Module | On? | Shown as | What it does for a game |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chat, the call | On | | The core. The chat all week, the call on game night. |
| Calendar (`calendar`) | On | **Sessions** (decided) | Session nights, with reminders. It is allowed in the Lobby. |
| Polls (`polls`) | On | | Picking the night, voting on the next quest. |
| To-do (`todo`) | On | **Quests** (decided) | A shared list with due dates and reminders. |
| Research (`research`) | On | **Lore** (decided) | Notes, links and pictures, tagged and searchable; the AI can answer questions about them when the owner has set one up. |
| Planner (`travel`) | On (decided) | **Campaign planner** (decided) | See "What the Planner does for a game". |
| Stream (`stream`) | Already everywhere | | Every player as an OBS source. This is the other half of the product for a game, so the games page names it. |
| Places and Maps (`places`, `maps`) | Off, offered (decided) | | Places and Maps draw the real world. A campaign map works only when the owner has set the environment's **Picture map** ([plan-map-image](plan-map-image.md): built, but not yet tried with WebGL). Maps needs Places. |
| Budget, Assistant | Off | | No fit. The Assistant needs the owner's AI key. |

A new campaign opens with the chat and the Sessions (`spaceDefaults.opensWith: ["chat", "calendar"]`, proposed, to confirm) and the `roleplaying` profile. The call is not joined on entering, as for travel.

Settings the template would set: `showCalendar` on, `calendarFeeds` on, `showMap` off (proposed, to confirm).

### What the Planner does for a game

This is the plan's own reading of the module (`modules/travel`, [userguide-planner](../userguides/userguide-planner.md)), stated plainly so the games page claims no more than is true.

- **What it is.** The Planner keeps one day-by-day plan for a space, from the earliest date to the latest. Calendar events, to-dos and polls that fall on a day join the plan on their own, so a campaign's Sessions, Quests with due dates and open polls appear together on one timeline. On top of that, people add objects of their own on a day: a note, a sight, a show, a meal or a drink, a stay, a journey, or a day marker. It has an Unscheduled list for things with no date.
- **What it gives a game.** One timeline of the campaign: when the sessions are, what is due before each, and the notes and places the group wants on a given night. That is real, and it needs nothing the module lacks.
- **What it does not give a game.** Its kinds and words are travel's. The add menu reads **Travel**, **Add a stay**, **Eat and drink**, **See and do** and **Add a note**; the Roles tab words its permissions "See the trip" and "Plan the trip"; the flight and stay forms have fields a game never uses. Of the kinds, a note, a sight (a place the party visits), a show and a bar (a tavern scene) fit; the rest would go unused. A template renames the module, not what is inside it. A game-shaped Planner, or sessions as a mode (#307), would be a change to the module and is not part of this plan.
- **The honest claim for the page:** "A day-by-day timeline of the campaign that gathers the sessions, quests and polls, with notes and places on the days." Nothing about flights, stays or itineraries.

### The Planner's name and icon

Decided (12 and 13): the Planner is shown as **Campaign planner**, with the icon `scroll` set through `moduleIcons`, since the suitcase would look wrong beside a game. The name must exist in Font Awesome Free solid; `check-templates` checks it.

### Phases

Decided: none. The Planner does not need them: without phases it shows **Edit dates** with an optional first and last day, and its days appear from the first date or the first object. A campaign has no main phase to count toward, and the sessions are on the Calendar. Phases for a campaign (for example "Session zero", "Running", "Break", "Finale", with "Running" as the main phase) would give the status strip a phase line and the Planner a phase tag on each day, but they would need dates the group has no reason to keep. Thomas decided to leave them out.

### The seed for the product page screenshots

A second seed beside the travel one in `tools/shots-seed.mjs`, run on the same fixed day (2026-10-15, a Thursday), with the same rule: every date fixed, nothing drawn that the server makes.

- The `games` template. An environment, a game master (the admin) and three players, with invented names; no names from any published game.
- Two campaigns: a long one ("The Ashen Crown", players Mia, Sam and Lee) and a one-shot ("The Lantern Fair").
- **Sessions** (Calendar): weekly on Thursday nights, the last two done, the next two ahead (2026-10-22 and 2026-10-29) with a reminder.
- **Polls:** "Which night for session 14?", with votes in.
- **Quests** (To-do): five, two done, with due dates.
- **Lore** (Research): four notes, a place, a person, a rumour, a house rule, with tags.
- **The planner** (the Planner, under its themed name): in The Ashen Crown, four objects of its own on fixed days: a note "Recap of session 13" (2026-10-15), a sight "The Ashen Gate" (2026-10-22), a bar "The Drowned Lantern" (2026-10-22) and a note "Bring the map for the vault" (2026-10-29). The Sessions, the Quests with due dates and the poll join the timeline by themselves, so the shot shows a full timeline without more seeding.
- **The chat:** a short in-character exchange, a link card and an Assistant answer, written by `seedChat` as for travel.
- **Pictures:** a Character picture for each player, so the OBS view shows both boxes (decided: one extra shot of the OBS view with character art). The art is experience-design's, drawn flat in the product page's palette.

## Left to build, in order

1. **The template** (server-development): `templates/games.json` (version 1) with the decided words (`space`, `environment`), the four themed names (Sessions, Quests, Lore, Campaign planner), the `scroll` icon through `moduleIcons`, `modules` as listed above, the Lobby, `dice-d20`, no `phases`, and the three proposed values (the remaining words, `opensWith`, `showMap` off), `tools/template-versions.json`, `tools/check-templates.mjs` and `check-template-switch.mjs` cases, and the Dockerfile if the file list is not a glob. Nothing blocks starting. The three proposed values go in as drafted; if Thomas changes one, it is a one-line edit to the file. Done when `npm run check` passes.
2. **The seed** (server-development): the games seed beside the travel one, including the Planner objects, selectable by `tools/shots.mjs`. Done when two runs give the same data.
3. **The shots and the games hero art** (experience-design; Thomas approves the art), including the OBS-view shot with character art and a shot of the planner's timeline, then **`/games`** ([plan-product-pages](plan-product-pages.md) steps 7 to 9). The page names the Planner only as in "The honest claim for the page".
4. **The documentation** (content-manager): the templates guide and architecture-environments.

## Verify

- **Step 1, checked by a tool:** `check-templates` (the file is valid, every module id is bundled, `chat` is listed, the icon names exist, applying twice gives the same result, a plan that leaves a module out records it as skipped); `check-template-switch`.
- **Step 1, live:** on `BASE_DOMAIN=localhost` with a throwaway `DATA_DIR` under `/tmp`, create an environment from the template and check that people read "campaign", "Campaigns", "group" and "moderator", that Calendar shows as Sessions, To-do as Quests, Research as Lore and the Planner as Campaign planner with the scroll icon, that the Lobby reads "Common room", that Places and Maps are offered but off, that no phases show, and that a new campaign opens with the chat and the Sessions.
- **Step 2:** run the seed twice on empty data directories and compare; open the campaign's planner and check that the sessions, quests and poll appear on their days beside the four seeded objects.
- **Not checkable here:** the call on game night, and the Stream sources in OBS, which need a real LiveKit server and OBS. The picture map with WebGL is also unchecked.

## What is not decided

### Open questions

Thomas answered the rest on 2026-10-21 (Decisions 8 and 12 to 14). Three remain, all **proposed, to confirm**. None blocks the template file, which uses the recommended values.

1. **The remaining words (proposed, to confirm).** `owner` game master, `aside` whisper, `member` player, `guest` guest, and `canvas`, `module`, `object` unchanged. Recommended: all as proposed in the table.
2. **What a new campaign opens with (proposed, to confirm).** Recommended: the chat and the Sessions. Alternative: the chat and the Campaign planner, if Thomas wants the timeline to be the first thing seen.
3. **`showMap` (proposed, to confirm).** Recommended: **off,** so the top bar carries no Map for a template that has no Maps. An owner who turns Maps on may then want the Map back.
