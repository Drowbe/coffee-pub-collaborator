// Loaded into a throwaway server (node --require) or into the check itself by tools/check-external-calendars.mjs,
// never by the app. It lets the real calendar reader (server/link-preview.js's fetchCalendar, its address guard
// untouched) reach a local stand-in serving iCalendar:
//
// - a name under cal.example.com resolves to 203.0.113.7 (TEST-NET-3, a public address the guard lets through);
// - a name under intranet.example.com resolves to 10.0.0.5, which the guard must refuse;
// - an https request the reader sends to either name, after the guard has passed it, goes as plain http to the stand-in
//   on 127.0.0.1:CHECK_STUB_PORT instead. So a request that wrongly got past the guard for intranet.example.com would
//   reach the stand-in, and the check would see it.
//
// Nothing else is touched: every other name resolves and connects as usual.
