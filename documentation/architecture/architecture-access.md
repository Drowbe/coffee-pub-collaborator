# Access Architecture

**Audience:** developers changing who may enter a space, the agreements gate, the guest door or request access (`server/space-access.js`, `server/agreements.js`, `server/guest-door.js`, `server/access-requests.js`, and their routes in `server/index.js`).

This is the shape of the access bundle ([plan-access-bundle](../plans/plan-access-bundle.md), steps 1 to 7). The plan is the contract; where the code differs, this says so. For the people's side see [Spaces](../userguides/userguide-spaces.md) ("Who can enter") and [Accounts](../userguides/userguide-accounts.md). The routes are listed in "The routes" below.

## One rule for entering

`mayEnter(viewer, space)` in `server/space-access.js` is the only place that decides whether a person may enter a space. It is pure: no store and no request. Every route and every list that needs the answer asks it. A viewer is one of:

- `{ all: true }`: the access key (OBS, Studio). Every space.
- `{ key, owner }`: a signed-in person. `owner` is true for owners and the admin.
- `{ guestSpace }`: a guest by guest link, for that one space only.
- `{ doorGuest: true, doorOn, granted }`: a guest from the guest door. `doorOn` is true while the host's switch is on. A door guest never enters the Lobby.

A space's `entry` is `invited` (the default when absent), `accounts` or `guests`:

- `invited`: members, owners and the admin.
- `accounts`: also anyone with an account in the environment. They become members by **Join** (`POST /api/spaces/:id/join`, `store.joinSpace`), which marks the space as one they may leave.
- `guests`: the same for an account, and also a door guest while the door is on.

`mayRequest(viewer, space)` is the second question: the space has `requestAccess` on, is not the Lobby, the viewer is a signed-in person or a door guest while the door is on, and may not enter already. A link guest and the access key cannot ask.

**Closed for set up** (`closed: true` on the space, #762; `spaceAccess.isClosed`). A space can be closed apart from its `entry`: `mayEnter` then lets in only owners, the admin, the space's moderators (a member ticked as moderator there) and the access key, and refuses everyone else, members included. Reopening restores exactly what `entry`, `allowGuests` and `requestAccess` were, because closing changes only `closed`. The Lobby is never closed. `PATCH /api/spaces/:id` takes `{ closed: boolean }` from owners, the admin and the space's moderators (`closed` is in `MODERATOR_SPACE_FIELDS`; 400 "closed must be true or false", 400 for the Lobby). `closedFor(viewer, space)` is the question "refused only because it is closed": such a person gets 403 `{ error: "This space is closed for set up.", closed: true }` and sees the space as closed on Home; anyone else gets the 404 of an unknown id. The call token, the space's notices and the published calendar tell outsiders nothing of a closed space either (#788). The four switches in Set up map onto the stored fields: **Members of the space** is `closed` off, **All members** and **Visiting guests** are `entry` (`accounts`, `guests`) and **Invited guests** is `allowGuests` (`entrySwitches()` and `withEntrySwitch()` in `public/space-setup.js`).

**A closed space answers like an unknown id.** A person who may neither enter nor ask gets 404 `no such space` from every route that names a space, so the answer does not tell them it exists. Only a space they may ask to enter is described, and only by its id, name, whether it has a picture and its description (`spaceAccess.requestView`).

## Agreements

`server/agreements.js`. Two texts, the terms of service (`TERMS_FILE`) and the beta NDA (`NDA_FILE`), are the host's: one pair for every environment on the server, read once at start. Each is UTF-8 text, plain or Markdown, up to 256 KB. A text's version is the first 16 hex characters of its SHA-256, so changing a text asks everyone again. With neither set there is no agreement step. A file that is set and cannot be used (missing, not a file, over 256 KB, empty) stops the start with one sentence, and a variable that is set but blank stops it too: a server meant to ask never starts without asking.

- **An account** keeps `agreed: [{ doc, version, at }]` in the environment's `app.json` (`Store#recordAgreement`). A person with an out-of-date record is sent to `/agree` by the gate, and every other route answers 403 `{ error, agreementRequired: true }`; a page request (GET, `Accept: text/html`) is redirected instead. `/agree` reads the texts from `GET /api/agreements`, draws them as text (never as HTML) and records the agreement with `POST /api/agreements/accept`.
- **A guest** has no account. `GuestAgreements` appends `{ guest, name, doc, version, at }` to the environment's own `agreements.json`; nothing is dropped.
- **The owner's copy and a restore.** `restoreEntries(files, { backup })` strips who agreed from a restored zip, so a copy moved to another server asks again. `?backup=1` on the restore route keeps it: that is the host's own backup of the environment. The host console's restore has a checkbox for it.

## The guest door

`server/guest-door.js`. A person with no account presses **Continue as guest** on the sign-in page and lands on `/agree` (the same page as the agreements, with a name field). `POST /api/guest-door` records the agreement and sets the `guest_session` cookie.

- **One switch, the host's** (#742). `ENABLE_GUEST_DOOR=true` on a single-environment install, or the per-environment checkbox in the host console on a hosted server (`guestDoor` in the host registry). It only makes the door available: `guestDoorOn()` in `server/index.js` is `hostGuestDoorOn()`. What a guest may enter is each space's own `entry` (`guests`, **Visiting guests**), so the door lets in nobody until an owner opens a space (`guestDoorHasOpenSpace()`). With the switch on and no open space, **Continue as guest** still shows and the guest lands on an empty Home. There is no owner switch, `settings.guestDoor` is no longer read, and nothing migrates it. `GET /api/settings` for owners carries `guestDoorHost` and `guestDoorOpen` (and `guestHours`) for the **Guests** section of Manage (`#guest-door-section` in `public/admin.html`, `paintGuestDoor` in `public/admin.js`), which is its own block, not part of Sign-up.
- **The session.** `guest_session` is `{ i, n, s, v, e, t }` (guest id, name, environment slug, text versions agreed to, the environment's `guestEpoch`, issued at), signed with a key made from the environment's own session secret and a different label from the account session, so it never reads as one and never works at another environment. It ends when `GUEST_SESSION_HOURS` run out, when `guestEpoch` goes up, when a text changes (the version no longer matches), when the host's switch goes off (the session stops reading and its live streams end), or on `DELETE /api/guest-door`.
- **One resolver.** `guestOf(req)` in `server/index.js` reads both kinds of guest, the link's and the door's, and returns `{ kind: 'link' | 'door', ... }`. Code that has to treat them apart checks `kind`; everything else asks the one resolver.
- **The register.** `GuestRegister` counts who is here now (seen in the last 15 minutes) for `GUESTS_PER_ENVIRONMENT`; `GUESTS_PER_SPACE` is read from the live presence, which marks guests. It is in memory: a restart forgets it, and a session still in date is counted again when it next asks.
- **Names** (#742). The typed name is stored and shown with the guest mark once, `<typed> (Guest)` (`guestDoorLib.markedGuestName`; the word is the template's word for guest, capitalised, and a mark already typed, in any bracket form, is taken off first so it is never doubled). Both kinds of guest, the link's (`POST /api/guest-join`) and the door's, are named this way, and every place that shows the name shows it as it is (chat, the banner, presence, the Whiteboard's pointers). The 40 characters count the typed name. The only refusal left is `mixesScripts` (Latin letters with letters of a script that has Latin lookalikes); the old refusal of a name that looks like a member's is gone. The other way round, `Store#checkDisplayName` refuses a member's display name that ends in the mark (#709, read from the code; the issue is still open).
- **Limits.** An address may open `GUEST_DOOR_PER_ADDRESS` new sessions in 15 minutes (429). Past the environment's cap the door answers 403.
- **The landing** (`public/guest.html`, `public/guest.js`, `GET /api/guest-door`). `/guest` says "You are in as <name>." and what a guest cannot do (`guestRefusals()`: asides and private conversations, muting or removing anyone, AI, library files, saving layouts, the bell and the status line and the all-space Calendar and Map pages, a profile), with a primary **Continue** to `/guest#home` and a small **Leave**. Home lists `doorSpacesFor(guest)`: the spaces the guest may enter (`open`) and those they may ask for (`request`, `pending`, with `answer: 'denied'` for 24 hours after a refusal), or `none` ("No spaces are open to guests at this time."). The page reads again every `POLL_MS` (12 seconds) while it is visible, so an approval or a refusal shows without a reload, and Withdraw reads the server first (#743). A module window never shows the sign-in page to a guest: a refused call is a plain sentence (#741). Never the Lobby: `mayEnter` refuses a door guest there.
- **Ending all.** `POST /api/guest-door/end-all` (owners and the admin) raises `guestEpoch`, which ends the door's and the guest links' sessions together.

## Request access

`server/access-requests.js`. One file for each environment, `access.json` in its data folder:

```
{ requests: [{ id, space, key | guest + name, at, state, until?, decidedBy?, decidedAt? }],
  grants:   [{ guest, space, until }] }
```

`state` is `pending`, `approved`, `denied`, `withdrawn` or `expired`. Every method is synchronous from its check to its write, so two answers to one request cannot both win. The file is written whole (a temporary file, then a rename), private to the server's user. A file that is there and cannot be read is set aside, said once, and a new one begun, never written over. It is bounded: old answers are dropped after 30 days and new requests are refused at 5000.

- **Who asks.** A signed-in person (`key`), or a door guest (`guest`, `name`, and `until`, the end of that guest's session, so an approval can never outlive it).
- **Approval.** An account becomes a member of the space (`store.joinSpace(key, id, 'request')`) in the same step as the answer. A guest gets a grant for that space until the session ends.
- **Deny.** A denied person cannot ask again for 24 hours; during that time the space's row carries `answer: 'denied'` and the page shows **Declined**. A withdrawn request does not count against the limits.
- **Limits** (`readLimits`): `ACCESS_REQUESTS_PER_DAY` for one person in 24 hours, `ACCESS_REQUESTS_PER_ADDRESS` for one address in 24 hours, `ACCESS_REQUESTS_PENDING_PER_SPACE` waiting accounts and `ACCESS_REQUESTS_PENDING_GUESTS_PER_SPACE` waiting door guests (counted apart) for a space, and `ACCESS_REQUEST_DAYS` before a pending request ends.
- **Notices.** A new request tells the owners through the bell (`moduleHooks.announce`), with a link to Set up, **Members** (`/?setup=<space>#members`). An answer tells an account who asked.
- **The owner's copy.** `access.json` is left out of an owner's copy of an environment and kept in the host's backup.

## The routes

| Route | Who | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/agreements` | anyone; 60 reads in 15 minutes for one address | `{ required, docs: [{ id, title, version, text }] }`, and `mode: 'guest'` for a person with no account while the door is open. 429 past the limit |
| `POST /api/agreements/accept` `{ versions }` | a signed-in account; 20 tries in 15 minutes | `{ ok, agreed }`. 401 signed out, 400 no versions, 409 the text changed, 413 over 1 KB, 429. Not there when no text is set |
| `POST /api/guest-door` `{ name, versions }` | no account | 201 `{ ok, guest }` and the cookie. 409 signed in already or the text changed, 403 door closed or full, 429 address limit, 400 name missing, too long, mixed alphabets or a member's |
| `GET /api/guest-door` | a door guest | `{ guest, permissions, spaces, unavailable, none }`. 401 without a session |
| `DELETE /api/guest-door` | anyone | ends this guest's session |
| `POST /api/guest-door/end-all` | owners, admin | `{ ok }` |
| `POST /api/spaces/:id/join` | a signed-in person | `{ space }`. 404 for a space they may not enter, 400 for the Lobby |
| `POST /api/spaces/:id/request` | a signed-in person or a door guest | 201 `{ ok, state: 'pending' }`. 401, 403 (guest link), 404, 409 (can enter already, or one is pending), 429 |
| `DELETE /api/spaces/:id/request` | the asker | `{ ok }`. 404 when there is none pending |
| `GET /api/spaces/:id/access-requests` | owners, admin | `{ requests: [{ id, kind, name, at, expiresAt }] }`, oldest first |
| `POST /api/spaces/:id/access-requests/:requestId` `{ decision: 'approve' \| 'deny' }` | owners, admin | `{ ok, changed, request }`. The same answer twice changes nothing; the other answer, or one to a request that is over, is 409 |
| `POST /api/host/environments/:slug/restore?backup=1` | host | keeps who agreed (see "Agreements") |

A space's `entry` and `requestAccess` are set with `PATCH /api/spaces/:id` (owners and the admin only; a moderator may not).

## Settings

These are environment variables, set in the compose file ([Settings reference](../userguides/userguide-settings-reference.md), "Agreements, guests and entering"): `TERMS_FILE`, `NDA_FILE`, `ENABLE_GUEST_DOOR`, `GUEST_SESSION_HOURS` (24), `GUEST_DOOR_PER_ADDRESS` (5), `GUESTS_PER_SPACE` (10), `GUESTS_PER_ENVIRONMENT` (50), `ACCESS_REQUESTS_PER_DAY` (5), `ACCESS_REQUESTS_PER_ADDRESS` (20), `ACCESS_REQUESTS_PENDING_PER_SPACE` (50), `ACCESS_REQUESTS_PENDING_GUESTS_PER_SPACE` (20) and `ACCESS_REQUEST_DAYS` (7). A value that is not a whole number above zero uses the default.

## Not verified

Read from the code and the plan; the checks that cover this are in `npm run check`. Nothing here was tried in a real browser by the author of this page, on a phone, or on a hosted server with several environments. A guest in a space with a module open was not tested.
