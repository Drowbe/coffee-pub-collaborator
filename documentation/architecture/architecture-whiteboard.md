# Whiteboard Architecture

**Audience:** developers changing the Whiteboard module, or writing a module that keeps one object per key and pictures.

What a person does with the board is [userguide-whiteboard](../userguides/userguide-whiteboard.md). The module's
permissions and storage rules are those of every module ([api-modules](../api/api-modules.md)); the SDK it calls is
[api-module-sdk](../api/api-module-sdk.md). This document is the shape of the module and the reasons for it. The code is
in `modules/whiteboard/`, version 0.1.64 (the sections written for earlier versions are read as before; "Boards" and "The Eraser" below are 0.1.50 to 0.1.63).

## Shape

The module is one page, `src/whiteboard.html` with `whiteboard.css` and `whiteboard.js`, and a set of libraries,
`src/whiteboard-lib-*.js`. `server/module-build.js` joins the libraries in name order and puts them where `whiteboard.js`
has `/*__LIB__*/`, so `lib-a` loads first and its two registries exist before the block and tool files add to them.

| Library | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `lib-a-core` | The block format, the palette, the widths, `wbClean`, the board state, `wbBetween` (layer moves) and the registries `blockTypes` and `tools` |
| `lib-b-policy` | The only place that reads `host.can` (`view` and `edit`) |
| `lib-c-sync` | The only code that touches `host.storage` and the `change` and `changes` events |
| `lib-d-render` | Drawing, the view (pan and zoom), handles, the selection frame, and `wbEditText` |
| `lib-e-block-*` | One file per block type: note, text, shape (rectangle, ellipse and the flowchart shapes), line, connector, stroke, highlight, timer, table, image |
| `lib-f-tool-*` | One file per tool or family: select, pen (pen, marker, brush), place (note, text, timer), shape (rectangle, ellipse, line, arrow and the flowchart shapes), connector, fill, highlight, table, hand |
| `lib-g-history` | Undo and redo |
| `lib-h-clipboard` | Copy, cut, paste and duplicate |
| `lib-i-pictures` | Preparing and sending pictures |
| `lib-j-markup` | What the formatting bar does to the words being edited, as plain text in and out (bold, italic, code, lists, heading, link) |
| `lib-k-table` | Rows copied from a spreadsheet, read as a table's cells (tab-separated text, or the words of an HTML table) |
| `lib-l-export` | The board as a PNG, and the copy that is printed |
| `lib-m-arrange` | Align, distribute, guides, locks and groups (plain work on boxes) |
| `lib-n-overview` | The overview: what the small map shows, the board-to-map sums, the press and the drag, and `createOverview`, the map itself, which only the page makes |
| `lib-o-find` | Find: the words each block is searched by, matching, reading order and the count; `whiteboard.js` has the bar |

`whiteboard.js` is the glue and the one path for every local change: `commit`, then `persist`, then history and sync. A new
kind of block or tool is a new file that registers itself; it does not edit the others.

## Blocks

A block is `{ id, type, x, y, z, fill?, stroke?, ink?, weight?, ...its own fields, by, at }`. `x` and `y` are board units (one
unit is a pixel at 100%), `z` is its place in the stack. Colours are stored by name (Ink and eight tints), never as a colour
value, so they follow the theme. There are three colour roles: stroke (Border), fill (Background) and ink (Words). `wbClean`
cleans every block read against its type, and its limits (`WB_LIMITS`: coordinates to 1,000,000, size and text to 4000,
6000 numbers in a drawing) are what keep a block under the server's 60 KB value limit. A layer move is one write:
`wbBetween` picks a `z` between the neighbours and renumbers only when the gap is too small.

A block type registers `create`, `clean`, `box`, `render` and `describe`, and may add hooks: `paint` (the roles it takes and
the extra choices `none` and `auto`), `weight`, `edit` (`'text'` or `'colour'`), `textField` with `textLine`, `textLabel`,
`textMax` and `editLabel` (the picture's Describe), `textEmpty`, `resize` (`corners` with `min`, `height: false`, `keep`;
or `ends`), `noun`, `linked`, and `refs` and `remap` (read by the clipboard and by the page's delete: the connector has them), `loosen`, `layout` and `attached` (a connector), `copied` (what a copy does not keep: a running timer), `grips` with `grip`, `gripBase` and `tap` (handles of the block's own), `actions` (right-click rows that change fields), `markup` and `reach`.

`linked` names groups of fields that only make sense together: a note or shape `[x, y, w, h]`, a text block `[x, y, w]`, a
line `[x, y, dx, dy]`, a drawing `[x, y, points]`, a picture `[x, y, w, h]`. Undo puts a group back whole or not at all.

## Storage and sync

A space holds several boards (see "Boards" below); the first is `main`. Each block is one key, `block:main:<id>`, and the whole block is written
each time. Last write wins: no version is sent, and a 409 path is marked in `lib-c-sync`. Two people changing
the same block at once is therefore a lost change, which the user guide says.

The sync rules, from the header of `lib-c-sync`:

- Writes go one at a time for each key, newest last. `saveSoon` waits 600 ms, so a run of arrow-key presses is one write.
- A change heard while this page is writing the same key is deferred and judged, in order, after the write. `seen` keeps the
  newest version known for each key, and a change that is not newer is an echo and is skipped.
- A 429 is retried after the server's wait, up to 8 times, unless a newer write for the key came meanwhile.
- A delete is the hard case, because the server numbers a key afresh after a delete, so a version cannot tell an old change
  from a later one. While a delete of this page's is not heard back (`gone`), every change heard for that key is answered by
  reading the key again (`refetch`), and what the read returns is drawn only if it differs from what the page shows. The
  wait ends when the delete is heard (the oldest pending one, made by this person), when this page's own later write is
  echoed, or when the delete is refused. A read answered after a newer read was asked for, or while this page is writing the
  key, is not used. This closed GitHub #471.

**After a dropped connection** (`lib-r-resync`, 0.1.47 to 0.1.49). The host's event stream can drop and come back with changes missed and nothing said. The page hears `host.on('reconnected')`, reads the board's keys again and gives them to `wbResyncPlan(known, remoteList, pending)`, a pure function. `known` is the versions this page last saw, `remoteList` is what the server holds (each value cleaned by `wbClean`) and `pending` is the ids being edited, dragged, held, drafted, waiting to be saved or waiting for a delete to be heard. It returns `{ put, remove }`: a remote block newer than the page's version, or not known, is put; a block the server no longer holds is removed; a block in `pending`, an equal or an older one, and a block this page cannot read are left alone. It is a merge, not `reload()`'s full clear. 0.1.47 did this on a timer as a stopgap; 0.1.49 does it on the event. Tests: `check-whiteboard-resync.mjs` (read from the file list; not rerun here).

The server checks `edit` on every save (`access.write` in the manifest), so `lib-b-policy` is only for what the page shows.

## Undo and the clipboard

Both live in the page's memory, for one person and one page. Reloading, or a whole-board Clear or restore, empties them.

History records only this page's own changes. One turn of the page's script is one step, and steps tagged alike within 1.5
seconds merge (arrow keys). `history.tag(tag, { join: true })` joins a step to the newest step with that tag however long
ago, even with other steps between; the page tags a picture batch `pictures:<id>` before each block's commit, so pictures
added together are one step whenever their uploads finish. The history keeps 100 steps.

Undo is field-wise and three-way. For each field the step changed, the block's current value is compared with what this
person left. `wbApplyChanges(list, hooks)` writes the result back through the page's one path, with the hooks `get`,
`remove`, `put`, `canChange`, `canCreate`, `clean` and `linkedOf`, and returns `{ left, kept, touched }`. The `linkedOf`
rule (`wbMergeBack`): a field goes back only when neither it nor any field in its linked group has been changed by someone
else since. A block with no field left to put back is kept; a block someone else deleted is left. The result is written as
a new whole-block change, and `wbUndoNote` turns the counts into the notice the person reads.

Copy and cut by key put a mark, the type `application/x-coffee-whiteboard-blocks`, on the computer's clipboard. A paste with
files and no mark adds pictures. A paste with no mark and no files, after a copy here, does nothing, so words copied in
another program do not put down the copied blocks. The copied blocks themselves stay in page memory.

## Pictures

An image block is `{ upload, w, h, alt, stroke, weight }`: the bytes are never in the block. The page prepares a picture
(`createImageBitmap`, long edge 2000 px, a thumbnail of about 400 px; over 5 MB it is re-encoded as WebP and shrunk), sends
it with `host.uploads.put`, then `thumb`, both with `scope: 'space'`, and only then saves the block, in one write.
`wbSniffType` reads the type from the first 16 bytes (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF), so the page does not call
`host.uploads.inspect` and each picture spends one of the server's 30 uploads a minute. A GIF is sent as a PNG of its first
frame.

The manifest declares `uploads`: JPEG, PNG and WebP, 5 MB a file, 500 files. Two limits are easy to confuse:

- **5 MB for each picture file** is the manifest's `uploads.maxBytes`. The server also refuses a picture over 100 million
  pixels (`MAX_PIXELS` in `server/vault-types.js`, used by `server/module-uploads.js`).
- **5 MB of stored board data in all** is `LIMITS.moduleBytes` in `server/module-data.js`: everything the module has stored
  for every space together. Pictures are uploads and do not count toward it. One block's value is limited to 60 KB
  (`LIMITS.valueBytes`).

Deleting a picture block never removes its upload. Undo can bring the block back, copies share one upload, other people's
undo history may point at it, and only the person who added a file or an owner may remove it. The one upload the page
removes is one it sent that never got a block. Orphan uploads stay with the space and count toward the 500 files, and there
is no tidy-up yet.

## Snap to grid and the colour strip

`WB_GRID = 24` board units, and the renderer's dots sit on its multiples; `wbSnap(v)` rounds. `ctx.snapping(event)` is the
page's answer: on when the toggle is on, turned round while `event.altKey`. The place and shape tools snap the new block's
corner, corners or ends; select snaps the held block's corner on a move (the others by the same amount) and the dragged
edges or a line's end on a resize, but not when the shape is kept; the **+** snaps the corner; the pen never does. The
toggle is a `host.ui.toolbarButton` with `id: 'snap'` and `zone: 'end'` (see "Toolbar"). Its state is in
`localStorage` under `whiteboard-snap`, off at first, and never in the board's data.

The colour strip is `#paint` in `whiteboard.html`, filled by `paintShown` and `updatePaint` in `whiteboard.js`: one button
for each colour role and one for the width, each opening `colourMenu` or `widthMenu`. The marks use `data-state` (`colour`,
`none`, `auto`, `default`, `mixed`, `width`) and the theme tokens in `whiteboard.css`. It is hidden for someone who may only
look. `.wb-paint` has `pointer-events: none` and `.wb-paint-btn` has `auto`, so a press beside the buttons reaches the board.

The zoom buttons use `host.toolbar.set` with `placement: 'titlebar'` and are heard as the `toolbar` event (`{ id, x }`).

## Toolbar

The toolbar is the host's (`host.ui.viewSwitch`, `host.ui.toolbarButton`, `host.menu.show`); the module adds no control of
its own. `whiteboard.js` builds it, left to right:

- One switch named **Tools** (`host.ui.viewSwitch` with `label: 'Tools'`) holds every registered tool that is neither `apart` nor in a `group` (Select, the Hand, Pen, Note, Text, Rectangle, Ellipse, Line, Arrow), and on a coarse pointer a last choice, **Select many**. That is up to ten choices; a switch holds 12. The Hand is a tool with a `mode`, not an `apart` button: its key (H) and its choice turn it on, and again off, back to the tool used before it (`toolBefore`, `goesBack`).
- A tool marked `apart` is its own on/off button after the switch (the Timer). Its key and its button toggle it back to the tool used before.
- A tool with a `group` is a choice in that group's menu, opened by one button (`GROUPS` in `whiteboard.js`): **Paint**
  (Fill, then the Pen, Marker, Brush and Highlighter) and **Flowchart** (the Connector, the shapes, then the Table). The
  Pen is in the switch and is also offered in the Paint menu. The button is on while one of the group's tools is the tool.
  `split` puts a line in the menu after that many choices.
- Undo and Redo, then **Text size and alignment** and **Line style and arrowheads** (each opens a menu), then Delete (made when blocks are picked) and Arrange.
- **Snap to grid** is a `host.ui.toolbarButton` with `zone: 'end'`, an icon-only button in the module's right zone, so the host holds it at the far right and never folds it into More (a module's first two icon-only right-zone buttons are held; see [architecture-module-window](architecture-module-window.md), "Zones in a module's own row"). It is made again after Delete appears.
- On a narrow board the host folds the row: the last choices of **Tools** go into More first (the tool in use always stays in the row), then the other buttons.

A tool declares `edits: true` when it changes the board; `policy.canUseTool` leaves it out for someone who may only look.

**Since 0.1.25 the tools are families.** The **Tools** switch holds Hand, Select, Pen, Fill, Text, Note, Flowchart, Shape, Table and Frame (`SWITCH` in `whiteboard.js`). Pen (`pen`, `marker`, `brush`, `highlight`), Shape (`rect`, `ellipse`, `line`, `arrow`) and Flowchart (`connector`, `rounded`, `diamond`, `pill`, `parallelogram`) are `FAMILIES`: one choice in the switch, the kinds as buttons on the strip, and the page remembers the last kind used for the session. A kind's own key picks its family with that kind. The Timer is `apart`. Zoom and **Find** are title-bar buttons (`host.toolbar.set`, `placement: 'titlebar'`), and **Overview**, **Grid** and **Snap to grid** are right-zone toolbar buttons. The Grid panel's style (`dots`, `lines`, `off`), size (8 to 96), colour and opacity are kept in this browser under `whiteboard-grid` (`wbGrid`, `lib-a-core`); Snap uses the same size. The board's background is a menu of Default, Light and Dark fixed colours (`WB_FIXED_BACKGROUNDS`) and the tinted washes; a pick asks first and is one save and one undo step.

## Connectors

A connector is `{ from, to, style, head, label, stroke, weight }`. Each end is `{ block, side }` (`side` one of `auto`, `top`,
`right`, `bottom`, `left`) or a free point `{ x, y }`. Where it runs is never stored: `layout` works it out each time it is
drawn from the boxes of the blocks it is attached to (`wbRoute`, plain arithmetic, tested on its own), so a block that moves
or changes size moves its connectors with no write of their own. While a block it points at is not on the board the
connector is not drawn. `wbAttachable` says which blocks take a connector: a block with a box of its own and corner handles
(not a line, a drawing, a highlight or another connector).

A delete is the page's, not the block type's: `remove` in `whiteboard.js` removes the connectors that point at the block first
(`connectorsOf`, from each type's `refs`), then the block, in one history step, so one undo brings back the block and then
its connectors, each with its own id. A block removed by someone else takes its connectors from this page too
(`missingRefs`). The clipboard copies the connectors whose blocks are all in the copy; a connector copied without one of its
blocks has that end made a free point (`loosen`). `ctx.attachAt` finds the block under a point, with a reach of 12 screen
pixels (20 for a finger). With Snap to grid a free end goes on the grid; an end on a block does not.

The two menus (Line style, Arrowheads) are `WB_CONNECTOR_STYLES` and `WB_CONNECTOR_HEADS` in `lib-e-block-connector`.

## Paint, the Fill tool and the Highlighter

A freehand stroke has a `brush`: `pen`, `marker` (wide, round, a little see-through) or `brush` (a filled shape, thinner at
the ends). `widths` holds one percentage per point, kept only for a pen or a finger that reports force, and only while the
stroke has at most 2000 points (`maxWide`) so it stays under the 60 KB value limit. A stroke with no `brush` is a pen's.
Each kind has a `usual` width (Pen 3, Marker 12, Brush 8). The highlight is a block of its own (`points`, `stroke`, `weight`),
drawn as one path in a see-through wash of its colour so it is no darker where it crosses itself; the Shift straight band is
`straight` in the block type. It does not lock onto what it covers; the design for that is noted in `lib-a`, not built.

The Fill tool makes no block. `wbFillAction` (plain, tested on its own) decides: fill a block whose type has a `fill` paint
role, take its colour with Alt (`pick`), do nothing when it has that fill already, or refuse. The fill colour is the page's
`next.fill`, the same one the Colour menu sets for new blocks, Yellow at first. The tool unpicks everything when it is chosen
so that the colour strip and the Colour menu set the fill colour and not a picked block's.

## Words as markup

A note, text block, shape and table cell have `markup: true`: the words are stored as written in the small markup chat uses
and drawn by `wbShowWords` through the host's `host.util.markdown` (escaped first), the one place that puts a person's
words into the page. `wbPlain` makes the plain text for a screen reader and for a block's description through
`host.util.plain`. `size` (`WB_SIZES`: small, medium, large, huge) and `align` (`WB_ALIGNS`) are closed lists each type cleans
to; the usual is a type's own.

The formatting bar is `wbFormatBar` in `lib-d-render`, put on the board by `wbEditText` when the block type has `markup`.
Each button is a function in `lib-j-markup` that takes `{ value, start, end }` and gives back the same, so the text box's own
undo keeps each change; `wbLinkAddress` makes a typed address safe (only http and https, brackets escaped, at most 2000
characters). A link in the drawn words opens in a new tab from `openLink`, which accepts only http and https; the browser's
own click, middle click and drag on a link are stopped.

## The note pointer

A note's `pointer` is null or `{ dx, dy }`, the tip's offset from the note's middle. `wbPointerClamp` keeps the tip between
`WB_POINTER.min` and `max` (12 and 800) units outside the note on every clean and every resize. `wbPointerShape` works out the
outline each time it is drawn: the side facing the tip and the base along it are never stored. The pointer is part of the note
for a press and for the export, but not of its `box`; the type's `reach` takes in the tip (`renderer.reachOf`) for selecting by
rectangle, layers and the export. The tip's handle is a `grip` of the note type.

## The timer

A timer is `{ w, h, length, state, startedAt, remaining, fill, stroke, ink }`. `state` is `idle`, `running` or `paused`.
While it runs nothing is written: every page works out what is left from `startedAt`, the server's time in milliseconds, and
its own guess of the server's clock. Start, Pause, Reset and a new length are one write each (`wbTimerStart`, `wbTimerPause`,
`wbTimerReset`, `wbTimerSetLength`, plain functions).

The guess is `createServerClock` in `lib-c-sync`. Its evidence is the `updatedAt` the module host puts on every write and on
every `change` event ([api-module-sdk](../api/api-module-sdk.md)): a write of this page's gives the offset to within half the round
trip, a change heard live gives a floor, a board read gives only a loose floor. Pages whose own clocks differ therefore show
the same time. A copy of a timer is never running (`copied`). A timer that ended more than 10 seconds before the page saw it
is not sounded. The page plays a tone with the Web Audio API only after a press or key on the page, and keeps the mute choice
in `localStorage` under `whiteboard-timer-mute`; neither is in the board's data. The words read out (`say`) are in a live region
(`#say`).

## Tables

A table is one block and one stored value: `{ w, cols, rows, cells, head, fill, stroke, ink, weight, size, align }`. `cols`
holds the column widths, `rows` each row's least height (null: as tall as its words, measured on the page and never stored),
`cells[r][c]` the words, with empty cells at the end of a row and empty rows at the end left out. `w` is always the sum of
`cols`. The limits are in `WB_TABLE` (20 columns, 50 rows, 500 characters a cell, and `textMax` 48,000 characters for all the
cells as stored), enforced by `clean`, so one table always fits the 60 KB value limit. The operations (insert and delete a
row or column, set a cell, step to the next cell, scale, drag a line) are plain functions that return the fields to change or
`{ refuse }`.

The page does the rest in `whiteboard.js`: the cell being edited, the active cell (a mark on the cell, never saved), and the
merge when someone else changes the table while a cell is edited. The table is not held while a cell is edited: a change from
someone else is drawn at once, and the cell's words are then written into the newest table with `wbTableSetCell`, so their
other cells stay. Cells are found by their place, so a row or column added above or left of the cell meanwhile moves the words
to the cell now in that place; a cell no longer in the table is not kept, and the person is told. The cell editor is
`wbEditText` with `keys`, a hook that takes Tab, Shift+Tab and Enter first. In a cell, Escape puts back only the cell being
edited; cells kept earlier are their own saves and undo steps.

A paste of rows is read in `lib-k-table`: tab-separated text (a tab on at least half of the lines), or the words of the first
`<table>` in the clipboard's HTML. The HTML is parsed by `DOMParser` into a document that is never shown, only its text is
kept, and the HTML is never put anywhere. At most one row and one column past the limits are read, so a cut is seen.

## Save as image and print

`lib-l-export` copies each block's drawn element into an SVG `<foreignObject>` the size of the part of the board exported,
with the module's own CSS rules that apply, the theme's tokens as they are now and the page's fonts (fetched once, as data
URLs, at most 1 MB). Pictures are fetched and put in as data URLs, because an SVG image may load nothing from outside. The SVG
is a `data:` URL, since a `blob:` URL with a `foreignObject` taints the canvas in Chromium; it is drawn on a canvas and saved
as a PNG. The words go in only through `wbShowWords`. The selection frame, handles, grips, connection points, the Fill tool's
mark, a table's active cell and an open text box are left out. A canvas longest side is limited to 16,384 pixels and its
area to 64 mega-pixels (`WB_EXPORT`); a larger picture is made smaller and the person told.

`wbExportPick` chooses the blocks (everything; the picked blocks and every connector whose blocks are all picked; what
overlaps the view), `wbExportExtent` the part of the board (a margin of 32 units round everything or the selection, none
round the view), `wbExportName` the file name ("Whiteboard 2026-11-09 1432.png"). Not offered: an SVG file, because a
`foreignObject` is drawn by a browser but not by most drawing programs.

The file reaches the computer through `host.files.save` when the SDK has it; the SDK has no such call yet, so the page makes a
download link, which works for a module that runs in the page (the bundled ones). In a sandboxed frame a download is blocked,
and the page says it cannot.

Print uses the host's standard Print: `host.standard.set({ print: { run } })` ([api-module-sdk](../api/api-module-sdk.md)).
`run` puts the same copy, kept in the page so it follows the light colours the host shows while it prints, in an SVG the width
of the paper (`.wb-print` in `whiteboard.css`); the host prints the module's content and the module takes the copy away on
`printed`. Print is not started by a key or a button of the board's own: only the title bar's menu starts it. **Save as
image…** is a `host.header.set` item with `overflow: true`, so it is in the title bar's menu, before the host's standard
actions. Both are available to anyone who may see the board.

## The board's background

One value for the whole board, shared by everyone who sees it, saved whole under one key beside the blocks: `_board:main:settings`, `{ id: 'settings', type: 'board', background, by, at }`. `background` is a palette id or `'default'` (the theme's own board colour); a missing key, or any other value, reads as `'default'` (`wbCleanBoard` in `lib-a`). The key starts with `_`, the module's bookkeeping, so a Clear takes it and its Undo puts it back without counting it, and a board with only a background has nothing to clear. The page puts the background back at once after its own person's Clear, so a Clear empties the board of blocks and keeps its colour. `wbBackdrop(id)` gives the ground and the dot colour: a wash of the tint, `WB_WASH` (18 percent) on `var(--surface-page)`, so it follows light and dark mode, with the grid's dots stronger on a wash than on the plain page. Anyone who may change the board may set it (`setBackground`). It is one step in the undo history under `WB_BOARD_STEP` (`:board`, an id no block can have), and an undo that finds someone else changed it since leaves it and says so (`wbUndoNote`). It is in the board's right-click menu on empty space and in the title bar's menu. Save as image with **Board colour** and Print draw it. Tests: `check-whiteboard-background.mjs`.

## Align, distribute, guides, locks and groups

`lib-m-arrange.js` is plain work on blocks and boxes with no page. `wbRect` gives a block's box (a connector has none and is never lined up), `wbAlignMoves` lines two or more boxes up to the box round them, `wbDistributeMoves` spaces three or more evenly between the first and the last, `wbGuideSnap` snaps a dragged box to the edges and middles of the boxes near it within a few screen pixels, and `wbArrangeChanges`, `wbLockChanges`, `wbGroupChanges` and `wbUngroupChanges` answer which blocks a command changes. `wbArrangeChanges` also returns `moves`. `wbLockedNote` is the sentence for blocks left alone. The page puts every change through its one path (`ctx.change`), so one command is one undo step.

- **Guides** are drawn by the renderer while a move is dragged, and only when Snap to grid is off and Alt is not held (`guiding`); the grid wins when Snap is on. Not for a resize or a line's end.
- **Lock** is `locked: true` on any block. `policy.canChange` and `canDelete` are false for it; `canLock` is true for anyone who may edit. A locked block can still be picked, copied, duplicated and saved as an image. Its mark is a padlock at the top right corner of its box, and its spoken description says "locked". Ctrl or Cmd L locks all picked blocks when any is unlocked, else unlocks them.
- **Group** is a `group` id on each member (`wbGroupId`, `wbGroupOf`, `wbGroupsOf`). Ctrl or Cmd G groups the picked blocks, with Shift ungroups. Picking one member picks the group. `wbCopies` in `lib-h-clipboard` gives each group copied one new id, and a block copied without the rest of its group has none. Resizing a group as one selection is not built.
- The toolbar's tail is Delete, then Arrange (`toolbarTail()`); Snap to grid is in the right zone. Tests: `check-whiteboard-arrange.mjs`. Ctrl+L and Ctrl+G were tested with synthetic key events, not in a real browser.

## Frames and Present

A frame is a block type with `container: true` (`lib-e-block-frame.js`; its tool is `lib-f-tool-frame.js`, key `s`, in the Flowchart group, and **Add a frame** in the +). A container is not attachable, so connectors do not join it.

- **Order.** A new frame goes under every block that is not a frame and above existing frames. A press on its empty inside goes to what is under it; it is picked by its title tab or its border (`FRAME.hit` 8 screen pixels, `touch` 16). Size: 480 by 320 new, at least 80 by 60, a title of at most 80 characters (`FRAME`).
- **What it holds.** `wbFrameContents` finds the blocks fully inside it, a frame inside it counting as one. Moving a frame (a drag, the arrow keys, align or distribute) moves them with it through `wbFrameFollow`, in one undo step; locked blocks stay. Copy, cut and duplicate take the contents; delete and resize change only the frame. A connector whose free end is inside a frame does not move with it (a known limit).
- **Present** is the page's `presenting` state (`{ order, i, view }`) with the pure `wbPresentStart`, `wbPresentGo`, `wbPresentSync` and `wbPresentWords` in the frame file. Frames are in reading order, a row being the frames whose tops are within half the first frame's height. `renderer.setView` puts the view (held to `renderer.limits`, zoom 20 to 400 percent) and Exit puts the old one back. The board is not changed while presenting and pan and zoom are ignored. It is each person's own and changes nothing, so someone who may only look can present; a shared "follow me" waits on the live channel ([plan-module-live](../plans/plan-module-live.md)).
- **Save frame as image** exports the frame's own box with everything overlapping it, without the title tab, through `lib-l-export`.
- **Menus.** A block's own colour reads **Default** (the paint choice `usual` is shown as Default, also in the text size and alignment menus).
- Tests: `check-whiteboard-frames.mjs` (15 cases).

**Presenting to everyone** (`lib-q-present`, 0.1.41 to 0.1.44). One person presents and the others follow. The state is one bookkeeping record in the module's storage, `_present:<board>:state` = `{ id, type: 'present', presenter, name, frame, move, dim, seq, at, by }`; its leading `_` keeps it out of the blocks' and the settings' sync. Storage is the truth: a late joiner reads it, the others hear its changes, and nothing depends on `host.live`. Who presents is settled by compare-and-set (the first write wins, the loser follows). The presenter rewrites the record every 10 seconds (`beat`); a record nobody has seen change for 35 seconds (`stale`, on the reader's own clock, never a comparison of stored time with another computer's clock) counts as nobody presenting. Rapid Next and Back or the slider are coalesced into one write 150 ms after the last. A guest has no user key and can only follow. **Restart** and **Jump to Frame** are `presentGo('first')` and a menu of the frames; the transition (`move`: `immediate`, `fade`, `pan`) and the dimming (`dim`, 0 to 100 in steps of 5) travel with the record, so a follower sees the presenter's choices. The spotlight is a scrim over the world with a hole the shape of the current frame, rounded as the frame is.

**Speaker notes** (0.1.44, 0.1.45) are the frame's own `notes` field, plain words drawn through the markup reader, never on the board. The notes mark in the frame's title tab (`blockTypes.get('frame').notes`, given `canEdit`, `open` and `icon` by the page) opens them. The presenter's notes box is local to the page and is never sent to followers. Read from code; the box's drag and its keeping inside the board were not run.

**Live pointers** (`lib-p-pointers`, 0.1.23) are `host.live` messages on the topic `pointer`: `{ x, y, tool }` in board units, at most one every 50 ms with the last place always sent, `{ gone: true }` when the pointer leaves. Nothing is stored and nothing touches the history. A person's pointer fades after 5 seconds of silence and is dropped after 20; at most 50 are drawn (the one heard from longest ago goes); a name is cut at 24 characters; the tool must be one of the board's own ids. The module's manifest says `"live": true`. The browser's choice to hide pointers is kept under `whiteboard-pointers`.

## The overview and Find

**Overview** (`lib-n-overview`, Show overview and Hide overview in the title bar's menu). A small map at the bottom right of the board: each block's box (from `wbRect`, so a connector has none), frames as outlines, and the view as an accent rectangle. A press puts the middle of the view there at the same zoom (`wbOverviewCentre`); dragging the rectangle moves the view. At most 2000 boxes are drawn, the lowest by z first. It is 160 by 110 CSS pixels, 120 by 84 in a narrow module (under 520px). It is hidden while presenting, on an empty board, and in a module smaller than 360 by 320 (`wbOverviewHidden`). The choice is each person's own, in `localStorage` under `whiteboard-overview` (`'1'` is shown), never in the board's data; where storage is not available it lasts until the page goes. It is a picture to the keyboard and a screen reader (no tab stop, no key). It only reads, so a viewer can use it.

**Find** (`lib-o-find`, **Find** in the title bar's menu or the `/` key). `wbFindWords` gives the plain words of a block: notes, text and shapes through the markup's plain reading, a table cell by cell (each cell on its own line, so a match never runs across two), a frame's title, a connector's label and a picture's description; a timer or a drawing has none. Matching folds case and accents (`wbFindFold`), searches for at most 100 characters, counts a block once however often the words are in it, and goes in reading order (top to bottom, then left to right). Changes to the board are searched again 250 ms after the last one, keeping the current match, else the one in its place. The matches are outlined on a layer of their own, the current one stronger; the view glides to a match out of sight and never zooms in; what is picked is kept. The `/` key is taken only when the board has the keyboard and nothing is being edited (`e.isComposing`, ctrl, meta and alt are ignored), so it still types in a note editor or a table cell. Escape or Close returns the keyboard to the board. Find is off while presenting. A screen reader hears "Match 2 of 7: <the first 80 characters of the words>".

## Boards

Written from `whiteboard-lib-s-boards.js` and [plan-whiteboard-boards](../plans/plan-whiteboard-boards.md) (0.1.54 to 0.1.63).

- **Keys.** A board is a record `board:<id>` = `{ id, type: 'board-record', name, order, by, at, deleted, trashedAt }`. Its blocks are `block:<id>:<block id>`, its settings `_board:<id>:settings` and its presentation `_present:<id>:state`. Today's one board keeps the id `main` and its keys; a space with no `board:main` record reads as one board named "Board 1" (opening a space writes nothing). A new board gets an id of 1 to 16 lower-case letters and digits, never `main`.
- **Trash.** Delete sets `deleted` and `trashedAt`; the blocks stay where they are. A board is kept 7 days, then purged: a claim in `_purge:lock` (stale after 2 minutes), at most 25 deletes every 15 seconds, the board's blocks first and its record last, so a purge that stops half way is found again. The page of anyone who can edit does the purge. The `main` board is rewritten as a live, empty board instead of removed.
- **The page's rules, not the server's.** The 10-board limit, the name rules (1 to 40 characters, control and direction characters removed, unique) and the trash time are enforced by the page (`wbCanCreateBoard`, `wbBoardNameProblem`), and the server takes any key an editor writes, so an editor can overwrite or delete any board, forge a trash time or write many records.
- **One session.** `createBoardSession` owns the syncs of the board shown and switches them; the board list is read and heard through a sync with the prefix `board:`. A switch sends what waits first, under the old board's keys.
- **Live pointers** use one topic for each board, `pointer.<board id>`. A guest's name already ends in the guest mark ("Gil (Guest)", see [architecture-access](architecture-access.md)), so the pointer's tag shows it as it is and adds the role word only to a name that lacks it (`wbLiveLabel`, 0.1.64).
- **Unsent changes** are kept in `localStorage` as `wb-pending:<space>:<prefix>` (the prefix has the board id in it), so they survive a reload or a closed tab. A board switch and a trash keep them; they are removed only when a board's keys are purged, or when the entry's board is neither listed nor in the trash. After the list is read, `replayOthers()` replays every other listed or trashed board's entries, each by its own short-lived writer, without switching the page. An entry's 10 minutes count from its first replay. A network error or a 5xx keeps the write and retries after 2, 5 and 15 seconds, then every 60.
- **The board select** (0.1.60 and 0.1.63). The boards are chosen from a `host.header` item of `kind: 'select'` (`id: 'boards-select'`, set in `setHeader`; [api-module-sdk](../api/api-module-sdk.md), "The title bar"), not from tabs in the toolbar (the tab strip and the **Boards…** entry of the title bar's menu are gone). `wbBoardsSelect` decides whether it shows (`wbShowSelect`: a person who may edit, or more than one board) and its label (the current board's name); `wbBoardsSelectItems` gives the menu as data: one row for each board (`b.<board id>`, the current one `current`), at most `WB_BOARD_MAX` (the current board takes the last place if it is past them), a disabled "n more boards exist" line, then for an editor a divider and **Manage boards…** (`manage`) whose children are `new`, `rename`, `delete` and `deleted`, with the enable rules of `wbBoardsMenu` (New off at the limit, Delete off on the last board, the trash count as the `hint`). A pick arrives as the `header` event `{ id: 'boards-select', value }` and goes to `boardsPick`; the menu itself is the host's (0.1.63), so the module no longer draws one. New and Rename ask with `host.ui.prompt`, Delete with `host.ui.confirm`, and the list of deleted boards is a `host.menu.show` menu opened from the select's `deleted` row. The last board shown is kept in the browser as `wb-board:<space>`. Escape from the toolbar or the title bar returns to Select (0.1.62, `whiteboard-lib-t-escape-key.js`, `wbEscapeRoute`), and the Eraser shows its icon beside its ring (0.1.61, `whiteboard-lib-t-cursor-icon.js`).

## The Eraser

`whiteboard-lib-f-tool-eraser.js` ([plan-whiteboard-eraser](../plans/plan-whiteboard-eraser.md), 0.1.50, 0.1.52). A choice in the Tools switch, key E. `wbEraserHits` finds the blocks whose drawn line is within the circle's radius of the segment the pointer moved along, of kinds `stroke` and `highlight` only; locked blocks are counted and passed over, and frames and connectors are never hit. Each removal goes through the page's `erase(id, tag)`, which joins the drag's history tag so a drag is one undo step. The cap is 100 removals to a drag (`WB_ERASER.cap`). The circle moves by a transform, and a removal does not renumber every z-index (0.1.52). The ring and the tool icon beside the pointer (0.1.58, `check-whiteboard-cursor-icon.mjs`) cost frame time on a very large board at a slow CPU.

**Insert tools** (`whiteboard-lib-f-tool-insert.js`, 0.1.53): with Note, Text, Table, Rectangle, Ellipse or a flowchart shape on, `wbInsertClickAction` decides a press on a block: a block that takes words (`def.edit` is `text` or `cells`) opens its words, any other block or a locked one is picked, and a frame, an empty board or a person who may not edit places as before.

## Checks

The module's own tests are in `modules/whiteboard/test/`: `check-whiteboard-sync.mjs`, `-history.mjs`, `-pictures.mjs`,
`-rightdrag.mjs`, `-live.mjs`, `-connector.mjs`, `-timer.mjs`, `-markup.mjs`, `-pointer.mjs`, `-table.mjs`, `-export.mjs`, `-background.mjs`, `-arrange.mjs`, `-frames.mjs`, `-boards.mjs` and `-boards-ui.mjs` (the board records, trash, purge, kept writes and the menu), `-eraser.mjs`, `-insert-click.mjs`, `-cursor-icon.mjs`, `-live-pointers.mjs`, `-sync-persist.mjs` (kept writes), `-minimap.mjs` (the overview's sums) and `-find.mjs` (Find's words, matching, order and count). `npm run check:module -- whiteboard` runs them, and `tools/check-module-tests.mjs` runs
them inside `npm run check`. They are not in the module's zip. The right-drag and paste tests send synthetic events; a
headless browser has no computer clipboard and the suite has not run on Windows. The export test covers the sums only
(which blocks, the part of the board, the size, the file's name); drawing the picture needs a browser and is not in the
suite. Nothing prints in a test. `check-whiteboard-live.mjs` and `-rightdrag.mjs` need Chromium and say SKIPPED without it.
