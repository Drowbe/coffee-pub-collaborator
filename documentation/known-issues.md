# Known Issues

**Audience:** anyone running Collaborator who wants to know what is broken before reporting it
as new.

A defect is recorded here once it has been observed, with a workaround if one exists, and moves to
the CHANGELOG once fixed.

## A call page left open across an update must be reloaded

After the server is updated to the version that renamed "the table" (step 3 of the Names plan), a call page
that was already open still listens for the old messages and asks the old addresses. Until it is reloaded, it
does not follow a pull aside, a recall or a return, and does not show who is online.

Workaround: reload the page once after the update.

## Opening a dashboard object a second time doesn't open the object

On the spaces page, clicking an object on the dashboard (a task, an event, a poll) opens its module and the object
the first time. Clicking it a second time opens the module but not the object.
GitHub #20.

Workaround: find the object in the module itself.

## Some data files are still readable by other users on the server

Since the security fix, `app.json`, `host.json`, `ai.json` and `secrets.key` are readable only by the server's own
user. The chat history and the modules' data files are not yet restricted the same way, and the checks do not yet
cover every case. GitHub #69.

Workaround: keep the data folder itself readable only by the user the server runs as.

## The console's Maps tab is too wide in the narrow layout

On the host console at narrow width, the Maps tab runs past the right edge of the screen.

Workaround: use a wider window or turn the phone sideways.

## Saving a bundled template reorders its module list

On the host console, saving an edit to a bundled template, such as Travel, rewrites the order of its module list,
even when only the description changed. **Review** then lists **Modules** as changed. Seen on 2026-09-30.

Workaround: none is needed for owners, since no offer is made to them. Ignore the **Modules** line in **Review**.

## The logo still reads the old name

The logo on the landing page and on the host console's bar reads "COFFEE PUB MAGPIE", the product's old name.
The words on those pages say Collaborator. GitHub #110.

Workaround: none.

## Opens with notes a module with no canvas as off in this space

A module that has no canvas at all, such as Stream, can be on a space's saved **Opens with** list when it was
put there through the API. The list keeps it switched on with the note "(off in this space)", where "(can't open on
the canvas)" is meant. Seen on 2026-09-30.

Workaround: none is needed; switch it off.

## Opens with shows an uninstalled module by its id

A module on a space's saved **Opens with** list that has since been uninstalled is listed with the note "(not
installed)", under its id rather than its name. Seen on 2026-09-30.

Workaround: none; switch it off to take it off the list.

## The bell's notices don't open what they are about, and there are no mentions

The bell in the top bar lists module notices, but clicking one does nothing: a notice does not carry a link to its
object yet. Nobody is notified when they are mentioned in chat. Both are the notifications step of
[plan-primary-nav](plans/plan-primary-nav.md) (decision 3, step 9), not built yet. Opening the bell marks every
notice read at once; there is no **Mark all read** and no way to keep one unread.

Workaround: open the module named on the notice (from its card on the spaces page, or the space it came from) and find
the object there.

## The Paste button on a picture only gets a PNG

In Chromium, the **Paste** button on a picture box receives a copied picture only as a PNG. A copied animated GIF
arrives as a still picture, and a copied JPEG photo arrives as a PNG, which can be larger than the photo and go over
the 20 MB limit where the same file would not. Where the browser won't let the page read the clipboard (and on a
server not reached over HTTPS, where there is no **Paste** button at all), only the keyboard paste works. Seen on
2026-09-30, in headless Chromium.

Workaround: Tab to the picture box and press Ctrl+V (Cmd+V on a Mac), which keeps a copied file as it is, or click
the box and choose the file.

## The Planner's first open in a space logs three 404s

The first time the Planner opens in a space, the browser's console shows three requests answered 404:
`_cursor:events`, `_moved:plan-keys` and `_moved:phases`. They are the Planner asking whether its stored
markers exist before it writes them, and they are expected; nothing is wrong and nothing is lost. They predate the
kind picker (Planner 0.15.1) and are noise to ignore when reading the console.

Workaround: none needed.

## Phases can look stale for up to 30 seconds, and for an admin who is not a member

The Calendar asks for a space's phases every 30 seconds to notice an edit, because modules are not told when a phase
changes. A phase edited in Set up can take up to 30 seconds to show on the Calendar. An admin who is not a member of
the space does not get the update at all and sees the old phases until the page is reloaded. GitHub #283 (a
phase-change event for modules).

Workaround: reload the page.

## The Calendar's Day view can scroll by itself at narrow width

At 390 pixels wide, the Calendar's Day view can scroll by itself, away from where you were. The phase bar now stays
in sight as you scroll (Calendar 1.24.9). Related: GitHub #287.

Workaround: scroll back to the place you want.

## A blocked pop-up leaves the call area empty

**Call position** set to **Its own window** needs a browser that allows pop-ups for Collaborator. When the browser
refuses the window, the call area can be left empty with no message and no retry. GitHub #288.

Workaround: allow pop-ups for the site and choose **Its own window** again, or choose another **Call position**.

## Narrow bands in the status strip hide their label

A phase that lasts only a few days is a narrow band in the status strip. When the band is too narrow, its name is not
drawn; the band's colour and its icon (when the template gives one) still show.

Workaround: open the phase sheet (choose the chip) to read every phase and its dates.

## The Planner's old "Spent" chip can stay on the strip after Budget is turned on

When Budget is on in a space, the Planner stops showing its **Money** view and its **Spent** chip. The strip keeps what
a module last reported for up to 7 days, and the Planner only clears its report when someone who can change the Planner
opens it. Until then the strip can show the Planner's old figure beside Budget's, and the two can disagree. It goes away
when a Planner editor opens the Planner in that space, or after 7 days.

Workaround: open the Planner once in the space as an owner, an admin or anyone who can change it.

## Budget is up to 30 seconds behind the Planner

Budget reads the Planner's priced bookings by asking again every 30 seconds, and when its window is shown or focused
again, because the SDK has no event that tells a module another module's objects changed. A cost saved in the Planner
can take up to 30 seconds to appear in Budget, and the strip's figure moves with it.

Workaround: switch away from Budget and back, or focus its window, to read again at once.

## Budget's burndown axis labels overlap at very large amounts

On Budget's **Overview**, when a target is very large (many digits), the labels along the burndown's amount axis can run
into each other. Reported by QA on 2026-10-14; not seen on a screen by the person writing this.

Workaround: the figures beside the chart ("Left", "Paid") are not affected; read them there.

## In the Calendar, today and the selected day both look like an accent fill

Since selected states became fills, not borders, the Calendar's day for today and the day you selected are both drawn
with an accent fill (today with the accent's 28%, a selected day with about 22% over the card). They are easy to tell
apart only side by side.

Workaround: none.

## Places saved before a picture map keep their old positions

When an owner sets a picture map, places already saved keep the real-world positions they had. They are not moved, so
they may sit in the wrong place on the picture. Places added after the picture map is set are placed on the picture.

Workaround: edit each place and set its **Position** on the picture with the target button, or clear the picture map.

## The pop-out call needs a browser that allows pop-ups

**Its own window** opens the call with `window.open`. A browser that blocks pop-ups, or an installed app that
restricts them, cannot show it (see the entry above for what is left on the page).

Workaround: allow pop-ups for Collaborator.

## A Calendar or Map editor in a narrow window is a narrow-layout sheet

When the window is narrower than the editor, the editor of a Calendar or Map part opens as the narrow-layout sheet at that width, not as a window the editor's own size. The page behind it keeps its layout.

Workaround: widen the window.

## Floating windows can draw over a lifted editor

While an editor from the Calendar or the Map is open, a floating module window can still be drawn over it.

Workaround: close or move the floating window first.

## The Planner's day heading wraps in a docked column

In a Planner docked in a column about 256 pixels wide, the heading of a day wraps: "Day 1 of 10" can break over three lines at 220 pixels.

Workaround: make the column wider.

## Some muted text on tinted surfaces is under 4.5:1 in light mode

Muted text on a plain surface now meets 4.5:1 in Strong Coffee's light mode, but three cases on tinted surfaces do not: the dates on phase-tinted chips (3.85:1), the counts on a poll's voted bar (3.78:1) and the struck-through titles of done objects (3.81:1).

Workaround: none; use a dark theme if the text is hard to read.
