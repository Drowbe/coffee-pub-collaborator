# Domains Plan

**Audience:** Thomas, who decides where the product page, the host console and the environments live; server-development,
who builds the door, the settings and the checks; experience-design, who changes the product page, Manage and the
console; content-manager, who updates the deployment guide and the architecture.

**Status:** draft for Thomas to decide, 2026-10-21. Nothing here is decided beyond the facts and requirements Thomas
gave. Thomas: today's install is `thepub.collaborator.coffeepub.ai`, which is long, and "collaborator" is a temporary
product name. He owns `coffeepub.ai`, the brand home for all his apps (Studio, Collaborator, 13 FoundryVTT modules,
product pages at `<product>.coffeepub.ai`), and `coffeepub.live`, and thinks `.live` makes sense: environments at
`<environment>.coffeepub.live`, the product page at `collaborator.coffeepub.ai`. The server will also be sold
stand-alone, so every address must bend to a buyer's own domains.

## Why

Today one setting, `BASE_DOMAIN`, decides every address on a server with environments. The product page sits on the
bare base domain, so the product's name ends up inside every environment's address. Renaming the product would then
change every address people have saved. Splitting "where the environments live" from "where the product page lives"
lets the product page follow the product's name while environment addresses stay put.

## What it is today

- **The door** (`server/index.js`, about line 2672). With `BASE_DOMAIN` set, the request's hostname picks a branch, in
  this order:
  1. a host under `PREVIOUS_BASE_DOMAINS` gets a 301 to the same path at the current base;
  2. `admin.<base>` goes to `hostRouter` (the host console);
  3. the bare `<base>` serves `public/landing.html` for `/`, the use pages (`PRODUCT_PAGES`: `/travel`, `/games`,
     `/projects`) and the short list in `BARE_BASE_PATHS`, which includes `/api/product/signup`;
  4. `<slug>.<base>` resolves that environment;
  5. anything else is a plain 404.

  Without `BASE_DOMAIN` every request is the one environment, and none of this runs.
- **Reserved slugs.** `RESERVED_SLUGS` in `server/host-registry.js` (www, api, host, admin, mail, smtp, imap, pop,
  pop3, ftp, ns1, ns2, static, cdn, assets, app, status, support, help, blog, docs). It is fixed in code, and `livekit`
  is not on it. The check sits inside `cleanSlug()`, which also runs when `host.json` is read
  (`cleanEnvironmentRecord`). So a name added to the list later would quietly drop an existing environment of that
  name from the registry on the next start.
- **Sign-up** (`POST /api/product/signup`, off unless `SIGNUP=on`). It makes the environment and its owner, then
  answers `{ url }` = `<scheme>://<slug>.<BASE_DOMAIN>[:port]/`. `public/landing.js` sends the person there. They are
  not signed in, so the environment's `/` sends them to `/login` and they sign in again.
- **The slug check on the sign-up form** asks `GET /api/product/environment?slug=`. A 404 reads as "is free", so a
  reserved name shows "admin.<base> is free" and then fails when the form is sent.
- **Sign in on the product page.** `GET /api/product/environments` fills the dropdown. The form posts top-level to
  `https://<slug>.<base>/login`; `POST /login` is exempt from `sameOriginOnly`, and the session cookie is `SameSite=Lax`
  and host-only. The **recent** shortcut ("Sign in to The Pub") reads the `env_hint` cookie, which `setEnvHint()` sets
  on `Domain=<BASE_DOMAIN>`.
- **What the pages write from `baseDomain`** (from `GET /api/product` or `GET /api/host/settings`):
  - `landing.js`: the hero's `yourname.<base>`, the sign-up field's `.<base>`, the "is taken" and "is free" notes, and
    `envUrl()`.
  - `admin.js` line 2489: Manage's **Upgrade** link, `<base>/#plans`.
  - `host.js`: environment links, `<slug>.<base>` hints, the billing webhook `admin.<base>/api/host/billing`, and the
    facts line "Sign-up: on, at the base domain".
- **Everything inside an environment comes from the request's own host, not from `BASE_DOMAIN`.** `baseUrl(req)` builds
  all of these:
  - personal links (`/j/<token>`)
  - OBS view links (`/view/<key>`)
  - invites (`/invite/<token>`)
  - guest links (`/guest/<token>`)
  - calendar feeds (`/feed/<token>.ics`)

  The pages use `location.origin` for the same kinds of link. They follow whatever address the environment is reached
  at, and none of them is stored with a domain in it. There is no email sending and no stream URL with a domain in it;
  the stream key is a key, not an address.
- **LiveKit** is its own setting, `LIVEKIT_HOST` (`livekitWsUrl()`, line 1129), not derived from `BASE_DOMAIN`.
  `docker-compose.yml` puts it at `livekit.<domain>` next to `collaborator.<domain>`, and the TURN `domain` in the
  LiveKit config matches it.
- **Previous base domains.** `PREVIOUS_BASE_DOMAINS`, saved in `host.json` as `previousBaseDomains` on every start. Built
  in plan-environments phase 1 for a product rename.
- **The start line** says "host console at admin.<base>".

## Decisions

These come from Thomas's message of 2026-10-21. They are requirements, not choices made here.

1. **No Coffee Pub domain in code.** Every host the server answers to is a setting. The brand name "Coffee Pub" may
   still appear, as `CLAUDE.md` allows.
2. **A single-environment install (no `BASE_DOMAIN`) behaves exactly as before.** The new settings are ignored without it.
3. **A self-hoster with one domain keeps today's layout:**
   - the product pages on the bare `BASE_DOMAIN`
   - the console at `admin.<BASE_DOMAIN>`
   - environments at `<slug>.<BASE_DOMAIN>`

   With none of the new settings, nothing changes.
4. **The product is unreleased.** No redirects or compatibility layers are needed for the move.

## The questions, with options

Each section ends with a lean. A lean is a suggestion for Thomas, not a decision.

### 1. The layout and the model behind it

**The model.** Three addresses, each a setting, each defaulting to today's:

| Setting | What lives there | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `BASE_DOMAIN` | environments at `<slug>.<BASE_DOMAIN>` | none (one environment) |
| `PRODUCT_DOMAIN` | the product page, the use pages and sign-up | the bare `BASE_DOMAIN` |
| `CONSOLE_HOST` | the host console | `admin.<BASE_DOMAIN>` |

**Thomas's install with this model:**

```
BASE_DOMAIN=coffeepub.live
PRODUCT_DOMAIN=collaborator.coffeepub.ai
CONSOLE_HOST unset            (the console at admin.coffeepub.live)
LIVEKIT_HOST unchanged        (see 4)
```

A later product rename changes only `PRODUCT_DOMAIN`. Every `<slug>.coffeepub.live` stays where it is.

**Is `CONSOLE_HOST` needed?**

- **(a) Leave it out.** The console stays at `admin.<BASE_DOMAIN>`. One fewer setting and nothing to check. A buyer who
  wants the console elsewhere can't move it.
- **(b) Add it.** It costs one more comparison in the door, a start check (it must not equal `BASE_DOMAIN` or
  `PRODUCT_DOMAIN`), and the console's own links. It lets a buyer put the console on an internal-only name.

Lean: **(a)**, until a buyer asks. Thomas's layout uses the default, and `admin` is reserved anyway.

**What the bare `BASE_DOMAIN` serves when `PRODUCT_DOMAIN` is set elsewhere:**

- **(a) Nothing:** a 404. Cheapest, but `coffeepub.live` typed by hand shows an error.
- **(b) A redirect (302) to the same path at `PRODUCT_DOMAIN`.** There is one place for the pages, and
  `coffeepub.live/travel` still works. The cost: the product page then lives on another site from the `env_hint`
  cookie, so its **recent** shortcut can't be offered (see 3).
- **(c) The product pages too**, the same files at both hosts. The shortcut keeps working at the bare `BASE_DOMAIN`.
  The cost: two copies of every page for search engines, and two places a person might bookmark.

Lean: **(b)**. One home for the pages. The shortcut is a small loss: the dropdown still lists every environment, and
people mostly keep their environment's own address.

**`PRODUCT_DOMAIN` under `BASE_DOMAIN`.** A buyer might set `BASE_DOMAIN=example.com` and
`PRODUCT_DOMAIN=www.example.com`. The door must check the product host before the `<slug>.<base>` branch. Its first
label is reserved automatically (see 2). If an environment already has that slug, the server refuses to start, with a
line naming the clash. Silently hiding an environment is worse.

### 2. Reserved slugs

**The list.** Today's list, plus these:

- `livekit`, `turn` and `stun`
- `console`, `signup` and `login`
- the first label of `PRODUCT_DOMAIN`, of `CONSOLE_HOST` (if built) and of `LIVEKIT_HOST`, each when it sits directly
  under `BASE_DOMAIN`

`RESERVED_SLUGS` (comma-separated) adds to the built-in list; it never replaces it. A buyer can protect their own names
this way. Thomas would add the names of his other apps (`studio`, say).

**Where the check runs:**

- **(a) As today, in `cleanSlug()`.** A name reserved later makes the environment that has it disappear from the
  registry on the next start.
- **(b) Only where an environment is made:** `addEnvironment()`, the console's create form, sign-up and
  `MIGRATE_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG`. An existing environment whose name becomes reserved keeps working. The start line warns
  once per start ("`<slug>` is now reserved; it keeps working, but no new environment can take that name").

Lean: **(b)**.

**What a person sees on a reserved name:**

- **Sign-up form:** the slug note says "`<slug>` is reserved. Pick another." as they type. It does not say "is free".
- **Sign-up on submit:** 400 with the same sentence.
- **Console create form:** 400 with the sentence.

**How the sign-up form learns a name is reserved:**

- **(a)** A new route, `GET /api/product/address?slug=`, answers `{ slug, free, reason }`, where `reason` is `taken`,
  `reserved` or `shape`. It is public and rate-limited like the lookup.
- **(b)** `GET /api/product/environment?slug=` answers 404 with `{ reserved: true }` for a reserved name.

Lean: **(a)**. One answer per question, and the lookup keeps meaning "this environment exists".

### 3. Sign-up and sign-in across two sites

`collaborator.coffeepub.ai` and `thepub.coffeepub.live` are different sites, not just different hosts. This is what
changes:

- **The words.** They already come from `baseDomain`, which stays `BASE_DOMAIN`. The hero reads
  "yourname.coffeepub.live" and the field reads ".coffeepub.live". No change is needed.
- **Sign-up.** `POST /api/product/signup` is same-origin on the product host. It needs the door to pass it there (it is
  in `BARE_BASE_PATHS` today). The answer's `url` still points at `<slug>.<BASE_DOMAIN>`. The person lands on another
  site with no session, the same as today.
  - **(a) As today.** They land on `/`, are sent to `/login`, and sign in.
  - **(b)** `url` is `/login?login=<login>`, so the login is already filled in, and the status reads "Made. Taking you
    to `<slug>.<base>` to sign in...".
  - **(c)** A one-time sign-in link minted at sign-up, so they arrive signed in. That is a new kind of token, and new
    security surface.

  Lean: **(b)**.
- **Sign in.** The form's top-level post to `https://<slug>.<base>/login` works across sites. The response sets a
  host-only `Lax` cookie in a first-party context, and the 303 that follows is a top-level GET, which carries a `Lax`
  cookie. The two-step code step follows the same path. **This needs a check in a real browser** (Chromium, Firefox
  and Safari); headless Chromium on `*.localhost` is close but not the same site rules.
- **The recent shortcut.** `env_hint` is set on `Domain=<BASE_DOMAIN>`, and the product page on `.ai` can't read it.
  - **(a)** When the product host isn't under `BASE_DOMAIN`, the page skips the shortcut. The dropdown and the form
    remain.
  - **(b)** The page links Sign in to a small page at the bare `BASE_DOMAIN` that reads the cookie. This conflicts with
    1 (b).
  - **(c)** A credentialed cross-site fetch. Third-party cookies are blocked in Safari and Firefox, so this is
    unreliable.

  Lean: **(a)**.
- **Get started on the use pages.** The link is relative, `/?template=travel#start`. It stays on whichever host serves
  the page, so no change is needed.
- **Manage's Upgrade** must go to `PRODUCT_DOMAIN`, not `BASE_DOMAIN`. `GET /api/product` gains `productDomain` (the
  bare `BASE_DOMAIN` when unset), and `admin.js` uses it.

### 4. LiveKit and what else derives from the domains

- **Everything inside an environment** comes from the request's host (see "What it is today"). Nothing changes, and
  nothing stored needs rewriting.
- **What derives from `BASE_DOMAIN`, the full list:**
  - the door
  - `env_hint`'s cookie domain
  - sign-up's `url`
  - the console host
  - `/api/product`'s `baseDomain`
  - `/api/host/settings`' `baseDomain`
  - the console's links and webhook
  - Manage's Upgrade
  - the start line

  Each becomes `BASE_DOMAIN`, `PRODUCT_DOMAIN` or the console host as appropriate. `GET /api/host/settings` gains
  `productDomain` and `consoleHost`, and the console's facts read "Sign-up: on, at `<product domain>`" and show the
  webhook at the console host.
- **LiveKit.** `LIVEKIT_HOST` stays its own setting; nothing derives it.
  - **(a) Leave it where it is** (`livekit.coffeepub.ai`, per the compose file's pattern; Thomas to confirm). Its DNS,
    certificate, proxy host and the TURN `domain` stay as they are.
  - **(b) Move it to `livekit.coffeepub.live`.** The wildcard certificate covers it, and call traffic sits under the
    calling domain. It needs a specific proxy host for it (an exact name wins over the wildcard), a new TURN `domain`,
    and a LiveKit restart.

  Lean: **(a)** for the move, so there are fewer moving parts. `livekit` is reserved either way.

### 5. TLS and DNS

**Thomas's install:**

- **`coffeepub.live`:**
  - an `A` record at the apex to the public IP (an apex can't be a CNAME)
  - `*` as a CNAME to the apex
  - one certificate for `coffeepub.live` and `*.coffeepub.live`, by DNS challenge
  - one Nginx Proxy Manager host with both names to the app on port 3000

  This host covers every environment, `admin.coffeepub.live`, and the bare redirect. A record Thomas adds later for
  something else on `.live` (`mail`, say) overrides the wildcard; reserve its name too.
- **`coffeepub.ai`:**
  - `collaborator.coffeepub.ai` keeps its record and gets an ordinary certificate (no wildcard), with a proxy host to
    the same app on port 3000
  - `livekit.coffeepub.ai` stays as it is under 4 (a)
  - `*.collaborator.coffeepub.ai` and its wildcard certificate can go once nothing redirects from it (see 6)

**A buyer with one domain:** nothing changes. One wildcard and one proxy host, as the guide says today.

**A buyer with two domains:** the guide gains one short section, "The product page on another domain": one record, one
ordinary certificate, one proxy host, and `PRODUCT_DOMAIN`.

### 6. `PREVIOUS_BASE_DOMAINS`

- **(a) Keep it** as a general feature, not as compatibility. Thomas's group has OBS browser sources and calendar
  subscriptions pointing at `thepub.collaborator.coffeepub.ai`; both follow a 301. A buyer who changes domain after
  release needs the same thing. The cost is that the old wildcard certificate and proxy host must stay up while it is
  set. Required fix: the door checks `PRODUCT_DOMAIN` (and the console host) **before** the previous-base redirect.
  Otherwise `PREVIOUS_BASE_DOMAINS=collaborator.coffeepub.ai` would redirect the product page itself to
  `coffeepub.live`.
- **(b) Drop it.** That is less code, in line with the no-compatibility rule. The group re-adds its OBS sources and
  calendar feeds once, and a buyer who renames later edits links by hand or redirects at their proxy.

Lean: **(a)**, with the order fixed. Thomas sets it for a few weeks after the move, then removes it and the old
certificate.

### 7. Moving Thomas's install

There is no data migration. The slug stays `thepub`, and call names hold only the slug. Nothing stored holds a domain;
`host.json`'s `baseDomain` is rewritten on start. The steps:

1. Take a copy of the data folder.
2. Add the DNS records and certificates in 5, and the proxy hosts.
3. Change the container's settings:
   - `BASE_DOMAIN=coffeepub.live`
   - `PRODUCT_DOMAIN=collaborator.coffeepub.ai`
   - `PREVIOUS_BASE_DOMAINS=collaborator.coffeepub.ai` (if 6 (a))
   - `RESERVED_SLUGS` as wanted
4. Recreate the container.
5. Check:
   - `thepub.coffeepub.live` signs in
   - `admin.coffeepub.live` shows the console
   - `collaborator.coffeepub.ai` shows the product page, and sign-up makes a test environment on `.live`
   - an old OBS link redirects
   - a real call connects
6. Later, remove `PREVIOUS_BASE_DOMAINS` and the old wildcard.

**Reset the test data?** Not needed; the move keeps everything. Reset only if Thomas wants a clean start anyway.

### 8. Documentation and checks

**Documentation** (content-manager, after the build):

- **`documentation/userguides/userguide-getting-started.md`**, "Environments: one server, several groups":
  - `PRODUCT_DOMAIN` and `RESERVED_SLUGS`
  - the two-domain section from 5
  - the `PREVIOUS_BASE_DOMAINS` paragraph, as decided in 6
  - the examples keep `example.com`
- **`documentation/architecture/architecture-environments.md`:**
  - the door's new order
  - the product host
  - reserved names checked only on creation
  - `env_hint` and the product page on another site
  - `/api/product`'s and `/api/host/settings`' new fields
- **`docker-compose.yml` comments:** the DNS and proxy lines name the two-domain case, and `PRODUCT_DOMAIN` and
  `RESERVED_SLUGS` are added, commented out.
- **The console's own words** (`public/host.js`, built by experience-design): the facts line and the webhook.
- **`documentation/plans/plan-product-pages.md` and `plan-environments.md`:** a line each, saying the product pages
  live at `PRODUCT_DOMAIN`.

**Checks** (server-development, with each step):

- **`tools/check-origin.mjs`**, using `BASE_DOMAIN=localhost` and `PRODUCT_DOMAIN=product.test` sent as a `Host`
  header:
  - the product host serves `/`, the use pages, `/api/product*` and sign-up
  - the bare base redirects with the path kept (or as decided)
  - `POST /api/product/signup` from the product host passes `sameOriginOnly`
  - `POST /login` from the product host's origin is still exempt
  - with no `PRODUCT_DOMAIN`, everything is as today
- **`tools/check-host-registry.mjs`:**
  - `RESERVED_SLUGS` adds names
  - the automatic labels (product, LiveKit) are reserved under `BASE_DOMAIN` and not otherwise
  - a now-reserved existing environment still loads and opens
  - creation refuses with the sentence
  - the clash between the product label and an existing slug stops the start
  - the previous-base redirect does not catch the product host
  - `GET /api/product/address` answers `taken`, `reserved`, `shape` and free
- **`tools/check-product-pages.mjs`:** nothing new in the shared blocks. The routing stays in `check-origin`.
- **`tools/check-names.mjs`:** a guard that fails on `coffeepub.ai`, `coffeepub.live` or `collaborator.coffeepub` in
  `server/`, `public/`, `modules/`, `templates/`, `tools/` (except the guard's own planted test) and the `Dockerfile`.
  Documentation and plans may name Thomas's install.
- **Single environment:** every route answers as before with `PRODUCT_DOMAIN` and `RESERVED_SLUGS` set but no
  `BASE_DOMAIN`, and the start line says they are ignored.

## The contract

### Server (server-development)

**The settings:**

- `PRODUCT_DOMAIN`: a host name, lower-cased, no scheme, no port. Unset, or equal to `BASE_DOMAIN`, means the bare base.
- `RESERVED_SLUGS`: comma-separated.
- `CONSOLE_HOST`: only if question 1 picks (b).
- All of them are ignored without `BASE_DOMAIN`, with one start line naming them.

**Start checks.** Each stops the start with one line:

- `PRODUCT_DOMAIN` equals the console host
- `PRODUCT_DOMAIN`'s label is an existing environment's slug

**The door, in order:**

1. the console host goes to `hostRouter`
2. the product host serves `/`, `PRODUCT_PAGES` and today's `BARE_BASE_PATHS`
3. a previous base gets a 301
4. the bare base, when `PRODUCT_DOMAIN` is elsewhere, gets a 302 to `<scheme>://<PRODUCT_DOMAIN><path and query>`, the
   port carried as today (or as question 1 decides)
5. `<slug>.<base>` resolves that environment
6. anything else gets a 404

**Reserved names:** `isReserved(slug)` is checked in `addEnvironment()` and for `MIGRATE_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG`, not in
`cleanSlug()`. The 400 says "`<slug>` is reserved. Pick another."

**Routes:**

- `GET /api/product/address?slug=` answers `{ slug, free, reason }`. It is public, served at the product host, and
  rate-limited.
- `GET /api/product` adds `productDomain`.
- `GET /api/host/settings` adds `productDomain` (and `consoleHost` if built).
- Sign-up's `url` is `<scheme>://<slug>.<BASE_DOMAIN>[:port]/login?login=<login>` (if question 3 picks (b)).

**Unchanged:** `env_hint` keeps `Domain=<BASE_DOMAIN>`. The start line names the product host and the console host.

### Pages (experience-design)

- **`landing.js`:**
  - the slug note uses `/api/product/address` and says "is reserved. Pick another." for a reserved name
  - the recent shortcut is skipped when `location.hostname` is not `BASE_DOMAIN` or under it
  - the sign-up status reads "Made. Taking you to `<slug>.<base>` to sign in..."
- **`admin.js`:** Upgrade goes to `<productDomain>/#plans`.
- **`host.js`:** the facts line names the product host; the webhook uses the console host.
- **No new words on the use pages.**

## Left to build, in order

| Step | What | Who | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The settings, start checks and the door's new order; the product host; the bare-base redirect; the previous-base fix; `check-origin` cases | server-development | M |
| 2 | Reserved names: `RESERVED_SLUGS`, automatic labels, checked only on creation, `GET /api/product/address`; `check-host-registry` cases | server-development | S |
| 3 | `productDomain` (and `consoleHost`) in the two APIs; sign-up's `url` | server-development | S |
| 4 | The product page's slug note, sign-up status and recent shortcut; Manage's Upgrade; the console's facts and webhook | experience-design | S |
| 5 | The `check-names` domain guard | server-development | S |
| 6 | The deployment guide, architecture, compose comments, and the two plans' lines | content-manager | S |
| 7 | The move of Thomas's install (DNS, certificates, proxy hosts, container settings) | Thomas, from the guide | S |

Steps 1 to 3 can be built and checked one at a time. Step 4 needs 2 and 3. Step 7 needs 1 to 4 released in an image.

## Verify

- **Steps 1 to 3 and 5:** checked by a tool (`check-origin`, `check-host-registry`, `check-names`), with `Host` headers
  against a local server.
- **Step 4:** in headless Chromium against a local server with `BASE_DOMAIN=localhost` and `PRODUCT_DOMAIN` set to
  another `*.localhost` name. Both resolve to the loopback, but they count as one site, so this does not prove the
  cross-site cookie behaviour.
- **Only after the move, on the real domains:**
  - sign-in from `collaborator.coffeepub.ai` into `thepub.coffeepub.live` in Chromium, Firefox and Safari, with and
    without two-step sign-in
  - sign-up landing on `.live`
  - an old OBS source and a calendar feed following the redirect
  - **a real LiveKit call**, which can't be checked locally (there is no LiveKit server here)

## Open questions

Each is answerable in one line. The lean comes first.

1. **Layout:** environments and the console on `coffeepub.live`, the product page at `collaborator.coffeepub.ai`?
   Lean: yes.
2. **`CONSOLE_HOST`:** leave it out until a buyer needs it, with the console fixed at `admin.<BASE_DOMAIN>`? Lean: leave
   it out.
3. **The bare `coffeepub.live`:** redirect to the product page (b), serve nothing (a), or serve the pages too (c)?
   Lean: redirect.
4. **Reserved names:** add `livekit`, `turn`, `stun`, `console`, `signup`, `login`, the automatic labels and a
   `RESERVED_SLUGS` setting? Lean: yes. Which of your own names go in it (`studio`, ...)?
5. **A name reserved later:** the existing environment keeps working, and only new ones are refused? Lean: yes.
6. **After sign-up:** land on the new environment's sign-in with the login filled in (b), rather than arriving signed
   in (c)? Lean: (b).
7. **The recent shortcut:** drop it on a product page that lives on another site? Lean: yes.
8. **LiveKit:** keep it at its current host for the move, rather than moving it to `livekit.coffeepub.live`? Lean: keep
   it. And what is `LIVEKIT_HOST` today?
9. **`PREVIOUS_BASE_DOMAINS`:** keep it as a feature, fixed so it never catches the product host, and set it for a few
   weeks after the move? Lean: keep.
10. **Thomas's data:** move it as it is, rather than reset? Lean: move. Does the install have environments other than
    `thepub`?
11. **The setting's name:** `PRODUCT_DOMAIN`, though it holds a host like `collaborator.coffeepub.ai`? Lean: keep the
    name, since it reads plainly beside `BASE_DOMAIN`.
12. **The build:** a production build (plan, QA, docs) rather than a try build, since it changes the door and sign-in?
    Lean: production.

Questions 1, 3, 4, 5 and 9 block step 1 or 2. Question 2 changes step 1's size. Questions 6 and 7 block step 4.
Questions 8 and 10 block only the move.
