# Accounts, Roles and Permissions

**Audience:** a game master or owner adding players to a Collaborator environment and deciding what
each of them can do.

## Add people

On the Manage page, **Users** lists everyone. Choose **Add user**, give them a login, display name
and password (or turn on a personal link), and open their profile to set up their pictures. Only an
owner adds people. **Role** is **Member** or **Owner**.

Each account can sign in either way, or both:

- **Login and password.** The owner picks both and tells the player.
- **Personal link.** Turn it on for a player and copy the link, something like
  `https://host.<domain>/j/2f3kd...`. Opening it signs them in and lands them on the list of spaces, ready to join.
  Regenerate it to make the old one stop working; turn it off to require a password.

Nobody changes their own password; an owner sets it. Sessions last 30 days. Changing someone's
password or regenerating their link signs them out everywhere.

Owners are made here, in Manage: give someone the **Owner** role. An environment can have any number of owners,
or none. An owner cannot change their own role or delete themselves; another owner (or the admin) has to. Owners
are called **Owner** on every install, single or hosted (see [Your environment](userguide-environments.md)).

Every server also has an **admin**, who has every right and is not an owner:

- **On a single server**, the admin is the account in the server's compose file (`ADMIN_LOGIN` and
  `ADMIN_PASSWORD`; see the getting-started guide). Its profile shows "Admin: runs this server", and its
  password "Set in the server's configuration." Its role, login, password, personal link and two-step sign-in can't be
  changed or reset from Manage, and it can't be deleted ("The server's admin. It signs in with the settings in
  the server's configuration, so its role and sign-in can't be changed here."). Its password is changed in the
  compose file.
- **On a hosted server**, the host admin can sign in to any environment. Their account there shows as **Host
  admin**, has every right, and its role and sign-in can't be changed there ("The host admin's own account. It
  signs in through the host console, so its role and sign-in can't be changed here.").

Every account has a **key**, eight letters and digits made when the account is created. It never
changes. Images, OBS view links and OBS source names use the key, so an owner can rename a login or
a display name without touching anything in OBS.

A player with no camera and no microphone still joins: they sit in the call with their picture, use
chat and reactions, and can be published to OBS like anyone else.

## Let people sign themselves up

Off by default. On the **Environment** tab, under **Sign-up**, turn on **Let anyone at /register sign themselves up** and anyone
who finds that link can make their own account, as a member in the Lobby.

Without opening it up, an owner can still **invite** someone straight into specific spaces: pick the
spaces and choose **Generate invite link**, then send the link. It works whether or not general
sign-up is on, expires after 7 days, and works once.

## Guests

A guest has no account, for someone dropping in once. While in a call, open the settings popover
(the gear next to chat and reactions) and, under **Guests**, turn on that space's link. Anyone with it
lands on a page headed "Enter <space>" that asks only for a name; **Enter** (a door) takes them into that space.
Where the template or the owner has changed the word for entering a space, the heading and the button use that
word instead (see "The words on two buttons" in [Manage](userguide-environment-settings.md)). A guest's first visit opens the conference and
the chat, unless the space's **Opens with** (or the environment's list for a new space) says otherwise. Entering does
not put a guest in the call: the conference shows **Not in a call**, and the guest joins with **Join the call** or the
green phone, when the browser asks for the microphone (see [The call](userguide-call.md)).

Anyone in the call with the right permission can turn the link on, copy it, or turn it off. It is a
standing door rather than single-use: it works for as many guests as show up until someone turns it
off or generates a new one. Nothing about a guest is kept once they leave. A guest with their camera
off shows the shared **Guest images** picture set (see
[Manage](userguide-environment-settings.md)). A space can turn guests off entirely with **Allow
Guests** on its own settings page, which also turns off any link already in use there.

Guests can't install Collaborator as an app. On a guest link there is no install hint, and the browser does not
offer to install; see "Install it as an app, and pop it out" in
[The call](userguide-call.md).

## Roles and what they can do

Open **Roles** on the Manage page to see a grid of checkboxes: one row per permission, and the columns
**Owner**, **Moderator**, **Member** and **Guest**. Changes save as you click.

- **Owner** can do everything, and its column is locked ("Owners can always do this"). The admin can too. Owners run the
  environment: they add people, set passwords and change settings. An owner also has every permission a
  module adds.
- **Moderator** is what someone gets in any space where they are marked **Moderator** on their
  profile's **Spaces** tab, on top of their ordinary role there.
- **Member** is an ordinary account.
- **Guest** is everyone who comes in from a space's guest link.

The permissions are grouped:

- **Modules** (the environment's word for it): see and join the conference, open and read the chat. Everyone has both by default. Without
  the first, a person enters a space for its chat and modules only and cannot send or receive audio or video.
- **In the Space**: send chat messages, send pictures in chat, use reactions, share their screen.
- **Asides**: start a private conversation, step aside with someone (recorded).
- **Moderation**: mute other people, kick other people, manage a space's guest link.
- **Images**: change their own profile photo, call background, and each of the Participant and
  Character pictures. By default only owners change the OBS pictures; everyone else can change their
  own profile photo and call background.

A permission that is off for a role hides the control for that person, and the server refuses it even
if someone tries the request by hand.

## Per-space settings for a member

An owner opens someone's profile and chooses the **Spaces** tab to see one section for each space they
belong to. In each, **Moderator** makes them a moderator in that space only, so they get everything
the Moderator role has there and nothing extra elsewhere. **Use Default Profile Images** decides
whether the space's own pictures replace their defaults, and **Remove** takes them out of the space.

## Your profile and signing out

Your picture and name are at the right end of the top bar on every page. Anyone with an account can use them; a
guest has no picture there and no profile menu.

1. Click your picture. A menu opens under it.
2. Choose what you need:
   - **View profile** opens your profile page. In a space it opens over the call, which keeps running.
   - **Dark mode** switches between light and dark (see "Light or dark" below). A tick shows while it is on.
   - **Manage** (owners and the admin) opens the Manage page; in a space it opens over the call. See
     [Manage](userguide-environment-settings.md).
   - **Host console** (a host admin signed in to one of the environments on a hosted server) opens the host
     console. From a space it opens in a new tab, so the call keeps running.
   - **Install as an app** runs Collaborator in its own window, without browser bars. It is there only while your
     browser offers to install (Chrome and Edge, before Collaborator is installed), and never for a guest; see
     "Install it as an app, and pop it out" in [The call](userguide-call.md).
   - **Sign out**, last. It also forgets the light or dark choice made in this browser, so the next person here
     starts from the default.

The menu also works from the keyboard: the arrow keys move, Enter picks, and Escape closes it.

On a phone your picture is not in the top bar. It is in the top bar's menu instead:

1. Tap the menu button (**Menu**, three lines) at the right of the top bar.
2. Near the end of the menu, after a line, are your picture and name. They are only a label; tapping them does
   nothing.
3. Tap an entry under them: the same ones as on a wider screen, with a switch for dark mode.

From the keyboard, opening the menu puts you on its first entry, Tab moves through the entries and back to the menu
button, and Escape closes it.

To change your photo, open your profile and click the photo at the top, or paste a picture you have copied into it
(Tab to it and press Ctrl+V, Cmd+V on a Mac, or choose its **Paste** button). Your other pictures on the profile
work the same way; see "Set a picture" in [Participant and Character Images](userguide-images.md).

## The Calendars tab

Your profile has a **Calendars** tab, between **Profile** and **Spaces**, with everything about your calendars in one place. It shows when the Calendar is on and an owner has turned on **Private addresses** or **Other calendars and busy times** (on the Calendar's configuration page; see "Calendar sharing (owner)" in [Calendar](userguide-calendar.md)); owners see it whenever the Calendar is on, so they can read where to turn a switch on; and anyone keeps it while they still hold an address or an other calendar. Guests have no profile. One line at the top says which way each section goes: "Calendars coming in are only for you. Addresses going out let your calendar app show events from here." Then two sections:

1. **Your calendars, coming in**: your own Google, Apple or other calendars, shown in the Calendar for you alone. See "Your other calendars in Collaborator" below.
2. **Addresses, going out**: private addresses your calendar app reads to show events from here. See "Your calendar in a calendar app" below.

Sharing when you are busy with a space's members is not built yet; it will be a third section here.

When something can't be used, the section says why, in place, rather than disappearing. For addresses: "Owners have not turned on private addresses in <environment>." (an owner reads "Turn it on in Calendar's configuration." after it, with **Calendar** as the link to the page), "Calendar is off in <environment>.", or "No module here has events to add to a calendar app." Other calendars have their own reasons, listed below. The names in these lines are the ones your environment uses. The tab reads its state again whenever you come back to the page, so a change an owner makes (in another tab, or in this one before going back) shows without a reload. `/profile#calendars` opens the tab; `/profile#calendars&space=<id>` opens it on that space's row.

## Your calendar in a calendar app

When an owner has turned on **Private addresses**, members and owners can add events to Google Calendar, Apple Calendar or Outlook through a private address. It is one way: changes in the calendar app don't come back. There are two kinds of address, under **Addresses, going out** on the **Calendars** tab:

- **Everything**, the first row: every event you can see in the environment, its own and those of your spaces, in one calendar.
- One row per space you belong to, with the space's icon and name: that space's events only, as a calendar of its own named after the space, for a trip you want as its own calendar in Google. When you also have an everything address, the row says "Your everything address already holds this <space>, so you only need one of them."

Each row shows **on** or **off**, and, when on, "Made <date>. Last read <time ago>." (or "Not read yet."; the time can lag by up to an hour).

1. Open your profile and choose **Calendars**. The section's line reads "Add events from <environment> to Google Calendar, Apple Calendar or Outlook. Anyone with an address can see its events, so keep each private."
2. On the row you want, choose **Make an address**. The address is shown once, in that row, with **Copy**. Anyone with the address can see those events, so keep it private.
3. Add it to your calendar app, following the steps under the address:
   - Google Calendar: choose **Other calendars**, then **From URL**, and paste it. The steps end "Google can take 8 to 24 hours to show a change.": Google reads the address on its own schedule, so new events, changes and deletions show there later. Apple Calendar is usually quicker.
   - Apple Calendar on a Mac: **File**, then **New Calendar Subscription**. On an iPhone: **Settings**, **Calendar**, **Accounts**, **Add Account**, **Other**, **Add Subscribed Calendar**.

**New address** replaces an address, so the old one stops working and you add the new one in your calendar app again; **Turn off** stops it. Both ask first. The address is shown only until you leave the page; after that, **New address** is the only way to get one.

A space's row can be used only while you are a member of that space and can see its Calendar; an owner or the admin who is not a member gets no address for it. Leaving a space, or being taken out of it, ends your address for it, and so does deleting the space. When a space's Calendar is off, or you may not see it, its row says "Calendar is off in this <space>." The **Everything** row says "There are no events here you can add to a calendar app." while nothing you can see offers any.

If an owner turns **Private addresses** off while you have an address, its row reads "Private addresses are off in <environment> for now, so this address does not work.", with **Turn off** still offered. The address is kept, and works again when the owner turns the switch back on. A kept address that stopped working for another reason (the Calendar off in that space, say) shows that reason followed by "This address does not work for now."

An everything address holds the environment's events and those of the spaces you belong to, as you may see them each time it is read; a space's address holds that space's, as you may see them there. Events more than 90 days past are left out. Repeating events repeat, a Planner object with a date appears once (as its Calendar event), and each event links back to the Calendar.

**For owners:** a person's profile has the **Calendars** tab too, showing each of their addresses on or off with "Made … Last read …" and **Turn off**: "<name>'s private addresses: whether each is on and when their calendar app last read it. You can turn one off; they can make a new one." Manage > **Users** also marks who has an everything address, with **Turn off feed**. You never see anyone's address.

## Your other calendars in Collaborator

The other way round: show events from your own Google, Apple or other calendar in the Calendar, for you alone. It is
the first section of your profile's **Calendars** tab, **Your calendars, coming in**, while the owner has **Other calendars and busy
times** on (on the Calendar's configuration page) and the Calendar can show them. Members and owners have it; guests don't. Its line reads "Their events show in your Calendar, only to you. In a <space>, you can share when you are busy, never what you are doing." (sharing busy times is not built yet).

1. Find your calendar's private address. In Google Calendar: open **Settings**, pick the calendar, choose
   **Integrate calendar**, and copy the **Secret address in iCal format**. A `webcal://` address works too.
2. Under **Your calendars, coming in**, type a **Name** and paste the **Address**.
3. Add it. The address is read first, which can take up to 15 seconds; one that can't be read is refused with the
   reason.

You can add up to five. Each row shows its name, its host and "Read <time ago>" or what went wrong, with
**Refresh** (once a minute; sooner, the row says to try again in a minute) and **Remove** (which asks first). A calendar too complex to read is refused with "The calendar is too complex to read." The address is never shown again. They are read
again every 30 minutes.

When other calendars can't be used, the section says why, and what to do:

- **Other calendars and busy times** is off: "Other calendars are off in <environment>.", then where to turn it on
  (Manage > **Modules**, in the Calendar's configuration).
- The Calendar needs to be approved, turned on, updated or installed in Manage > **Modules**. When it needs to be
  installed, updated or approved and the switch is also off, the section names that step first, then the switch,
  since the switch can't be turned on until the step is done.
- The Calendar can't run: it was built for an older version of Collaborator and needs an update (from a newer copy on
  this server, or from its author), or a module it needs is off or needs an update itself.

An owner is told to do it; anyone else is told their owner needs to. Calendars you already added stay listed with
**Remove**. If your calendars can't be loaded at all, the section says "Your other calendars could not be loaded", with the reason (such as "the server didn't answer"), and asks you to reload the page.

The section reads its state again whenever you come back to the page, so after an owner approves or turns on the
Calendar in Manage (in another tab, or in this one before going back), the form appears without a reload. Your
calendars keep their rows, and the button you were on keeps its place, while it does.

## Light or dark

**Dark mode** in the menu under your picture (on a phone, the sun and moon switch in the top bar's menu) changes
between light and dark at once, with no refresh. Your choice is kept on your account and follows you to your other
devices. Once you have used it, you keep your choice even when the owner changes the environment's default. A guest
has no switch and always sees the environment's default.

## Two-step sign-in

A second step after the password, if you or your owner want one: a six-digit code from an authenticator app on your phone, the standard kind that any such app makes.

- **Turning it on.** On your profile, under **Two-step sign-in**, choose **Turn on**: scan the square with the app (or type the key under it into the app), then type the six digits the app shows. The page then shows ten **recovery codes**, once: keep them somewhere safe. Each one signs you in a single time if the app is ever gone.
- **Signing in.** After your password, a page asks for the app's code. Tick **Remember this browser for 30 days** and that browser is not asked again for a month. **Use a recovery code instead** takes one of the saved codes, which is then spent.
- **A personal link** still gets the code step once you have one; it is the first step, not a way around the second.
- **Turning it off** asks for a code. If the environment requires it (below), it cannot be turned off.
- **Locked out.** Ask an owner: on your profile they can **Reset your second factor**, which signs you out everywhere and lets you set it up again. An owner locked out of their own account on a hosted server asks the host; on a single server, the operator turns on the lockout bypass (`ADMIN_MFA_LOCKOUT_BYPASS`) in the compose file, signs in on the password, and presses **Reset my second factor** on their profile (see the getting-started guide).
- **The rule for the whole environment** is one switch on Manage > Environment, under the sign-in page: **Require two-step sign-in for everyone**. Off (the default), anyone may set it up and is then asked; on, everyone must, from their next sign-in, which lands on the set-up page first; a session already open keeps working. Whether the server offers two-step sign-in at all is the operator's compose setting; when it does not, none of this appears.
