# Settings Reference

**Audience:** the person running the server, who wants to change a setting that is not in `docker-compose.yml`.

The compose file holds only the settings most servers must set. Everything here is optional: add a line under the
app's `environment:` (the `chameleon` service), recreate the container, and it takes effect. A setting left out uses
its default. The default is what the code uses today, checked against the server's source. To set up the server
first, see [Getting Started](userguide-getting-started.md). Put no real password or key in any file you share.

A number that is missing, not a number, or zero or less uses the default. Settings marked "in the file" are already in
the compose file.

## Environments and domains

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `BASE_DOMAIN` | unset (one environment) | Several environments on one server, at `<slug>.<base domain>`. A commented example in the file. See [Getting Started](userguide-getting-started.md), "Environments: one server, several groups". |
| `PRODUCT_DOMAIN` | unset | Puts the start page and sign-up on a host of their own, so their name can change without touching any environment's address. A host name only: no `https://`, no port. It needs its own DNS record, an ordinary certificate and a proxy host to port 3000; the base domain keeps the wildcard. The console stays at `admin.<base domain>`. Ignored without `BASE_DOMAIN`. A commented example in the file. |
| `PRODUCT_SITE_URL` | unset; for example `https://www.example.com/collaborator` | The address of the product's page on your website. When it is set, the start page shows the studio's parts (the header's **Support** and **Find Out More**, **Request an Invite**, the **Ways to use** cards and the footer); every link is built from this address's origin. A full `http://` or `https://` address. Unset means no link. A value that is not a web address stops the start with one line naming it. Only for a server with `BASE_DOMAIN`. A commented example in the file. |
| `MIGRATE_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG` | unset | For one start only: the environment that the data already here becomes, when you turn a single-environment install into several. Remove it afterwards. |
| `PREVIOUS_BASE_DOMAINS` | empty | Old base domains whose links redirect to the new one while you move a server's addresses ("Moving a server's addresses" in the guide). |
| `RESERVED_SLUGS` | empty; for example `studio,shop` | Names no new environment may take, on top of the built-in list (`www`, `api`, `admin`, `mail`, `livekit` and others). Comma separated. An environment that already has one keeps working. |
| `TEMPLATE` | unset; for example `travel` | One environment set up for one use, from a template in `templates/`: its words, icons, modules and Lobby. Only on a fresh data folder, and only without `BASE_DOMAIN` (with it, the host console and sign-up pick a template for each new environment). Ignored, with a line in the log, on data that already exists. |
| `SIGNUP` | off | `on` turns on the server's sign-up route for a free environment. The start page has no sign-up form now, so nothing a person sees uses it yet. Needs `BASE_DOMAIN`. |
| `CONTACT_EMAIL` | unset | Where the sign-up answer sends someone to write when sign-up is off. A commented example in the file. |

## AI

Keys, providers and models are not set here. A host's keys are set on the host console's **AI** tab, and a single server's AI on the AI configuration page, so there is nothing to put in the file. The old variables (`AI_OPENAI_KEY`, `AI_ANTHROPIC_KEY`, `AI_ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE`, `AI_KEY`, `TAVERN_AI_KEY`, `AI_PROVIDER`, `AI_ADDRESS` and `AI_MODEL`) are removed; if still set, they are ignored.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `AI_ALLOW_HTTP` | unset | With `BASE_DOMAIN`, the AI address an environment's owner types must be https and never a private, loopback or link-local address. `1` allows plain http. For a developer running the host on one machine only. |
| `AI_ALLOW_PRIVATE_ADDRESSES` | unset | The same guard: `1` allows private addresses. For a developer running the host on one machine only. |

## Sign-in and limits

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `ENABLE_MFA` | `true` (in the file) | Whether the server offers two-step sign-in (a code from an authenticator app). Each environment's owner then chooses whether to require it, and each person chooses whether to use it. |
| `ADMIN_MFA_LOCKOUT_BYPASS` | `false` (in the file) | If an owner or admin is locked out: set `true`, recreate, sign in, reset the factor on the profile, then set it back to `false`. |
| `HOST_MFA_REQUIRED` | `false` | With environments: `true` makes two-step sign-in mandatory for every host admin. |
| `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS` | `1` | How many reverse proxies stand in front of the container (`1` is the Nginx Proxy Manager). Sign-in and guest limits count by the address the nearest proxy saw, so nobody can pick their own. Two in a row (say Cloudflare, then Nginx Proxy Manager): `2`. Reached directly with no proxy: `0`. A value that is not a whole number logs a line and uses `1`. |
| `REQUEST_BODY_SECONDS` | `300` | How long the body of any other request may take to arrive. Vault uploads are exempt. |
| `CLEAR_UNDO_SECONDS` | `30` | How long a Clear can be undone. A whole number from 1 to 600. |
| `PORT` | `3000` (in the file) | The port the app listens on. |

## Chat and streams

The defaults are usually right. A live stream is one per open browser tab: it carries who is here and the chat.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `LIVE_STREAMS_PER_PERSON` | `50` | Streams one signed-in person may hold open. |
| `LIVE_STREAMS_PER_GUEST_LINK` | `25` | Streams one guest link may hold open. One address gets 40% of it. |
| `GUEST_CHAT_POSTS_PER_MINUTE` | `20` | Messages one guest link may post a minute. One address gets half. |
| `CHAT_PICTURE_MAX_MB` | `3` | The most a picture in the chat may weigh. It is held in memory and never stored. |
| `CHAT_PICTURE_KEEP_MINUTES` | `15` | How long a chat picture is held for its readers to fetch. |
| `CHAT_PICTURE_SPACE_MB` | `30` | MB of chat pictures held per space. Past it, the oldest go. |
| `CHAT_PICTURE_ENVIRONMENT_MB` | `100` | The same, per environment. |
| `CHAT_PICTURE_SERVER_MB` | `200` | The same, for the whole server. |
| `CHAT_PICTURE_MB_PER_MINUTE` | `20` | MB of pictures one person, or one guest link, may send a minute. |
| `LIVE_STREAM_BUFFER_MB` | `8` | How far a reader may fall behind before its stream is dropped. It reconnects. |
| `PRESENCE_CHANGES_PER_MINUTE` | `60` | Times a minute one person may switch away, or onto the call, in a space. |
| `MAP_IMAGE_MAX_MB` | `100` | The most a picture-map file (an invented world, as PMTiles picture tiles) may weigh. |

Each held total is never below one picture of the largest size.

## Vault

The Vault's files live in their own folder, not in the data folder, so the in-app backups stay small. Back that
folder up with the data folder: a restore of the data without it shows those files as "File missing". These limits are
the server's defaults; an owner may set lower ones. See [Vault](userguide-vault.md).

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `VAULT_DIR` | `/app/vault` (in the file, with its own volume line) | The folder that holds the Vault's files. Without it the files go in a `vault` folder inside the data folder. |
| `VAULT_MAX_GB` | `20` | The most the whole folder may hold. |
| `VAULT_SPACE_MAX_GB` | `5` | The most one space may hold. |
| `VAULT_PERSON_MAX_GB` | `2` | The most one person may have added across an environment. |
| `VAULT_MB_PER_MINUTE` | `500` | MB one person may send a minute. |
| `VAULT_MIN_KB_PER_SECOND` | `16` | The slowest an upload may arrive, after its first minute. |
| `VAULT_SLOW_CUTOFFS` | `3` | How many slow cut-offs, within `VAULT_SLOW_MINUTES`, make a person's new uploads wait. |
| `VAULT_SLOW_MINUTES` | `10` | The window for the count above. |
| `VAULT_SCAN_SECONDS` | `5` | The most the check of one file may take. |
| `VAULT_SWEEP_SECONDS` | `10` | The most the tidy-up on start may take (bytes with no record, leftovers). |

## Agreements, guests and entering

These settings are the server's, not an environment's. A value that is not a whole number above zero uses the default. How it works is in [Access architecture](../architecture/architecture-access.md).

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `TERMS_FILE` | unset | The path of a text file (plain or Markdown, UTF-8, at most 256 KB) with the terms of service. Everyone, in every environment, must agree to it before entering, once for each version of the text. Changing the file asks everyone again. A file that is missing, empty or too big, or a setting left blank, stops the server from starting. A commented example is in the file. |
| `NDA_FILE` | unset | The same for a beta NDA. With neither file set, nobody is asked. |
| `ENABLE_GUEST_DOOR` | `false` | On a single-environment install, whether the guest door is offered. Owners then open individual spaces to guests (**Visiting guests** in a space's Set up); there is no owner switch for the door. On a server with environments this is the host console's checkbox for each environment. |
| `GUEST_SESSION_HOURS` | `24` | How long a guest from the door stays in. |
| `GUEST_DOOR_PER_ADDRESS` | `5` | New guest sessions one address may open in 15 minutes. |
| `GUESTS_PER_SPACE` | `10` | Guests from the door who may be in one space at once. |
| `GUESTS_PER_ENVIRONMENT` | `50` | Guests from the door who may be in one environment at once. |
| `ACCESS_REQUESTS_PER_DAY` | `5` | Requests to enter a space that one person may make in 24 hours. |
| `ACCESS_REQUESTS_PER_ADDRESS` | `20` | Requests that one address may make in 24 hours. |
| `ACCESS_REQUESTS_PENDING_PER_SPACE` | `50` | People with an account who may be waiting to enter one space. |
| `ACCESS_REQUESTS_PENDING_GUESTS_PER_SPACE` | `20` | Guests who may be waiting to enter one space, counted apart. |
| `ACCESS_REQUEST_DAYS` | `7` | How long a request waits before it ends. |

## Other

`SHARE_UNLOCKS_PER_MINUTE` (default `60`) caps how many share-link password checks an environment does a minute. It is
described in [Getting Started](userguide-getting-started.md), "Environments: one server, several groups".

The About page's studio card is set with `STUDIO_NAME` (default "Coffee Pub Studio"), `STUDIO_LOGO_FILE` and `STUDIO_LOGO_DARK_FILE` (a picture file on the server; with only one, it is used for both), and `STUDIO_URL`, `STUDIO_PRODUCT_URL`, `STUDIO_CONTACT_URL` and `STUDIO_SUPPORT_URL` (web addresses, and `STUDIO_CONTACT_URL` may be a `mailto:` address; an empty link is not shown and one that is not valid is dropped with a warning). They are read once at start.
