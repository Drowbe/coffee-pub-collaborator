# Participant and Character Images

**Audience:** a game master or player setting the pictures that Collaborator and OBS show for
each player.

Each user has two things the recording can show, and both react to the same live signal: who is
speaking and who is muted. Both can be set once as a **Default** on the account and, for a space,
replaced just for that space. Which of the two a space offers depends on that space's **Profile**.

Each has pictures for **Offline**, **Online**, **Talking** and **Muted**, and the Participant box adds
**Aside** and **Private**. The box always shows Offline or Online depending on whether the person is
in the call, and lays Talking or Muted on top while they speak or while their microphone is off. Any
picture left unset is simply not drawn.

## Who can change what

Every person's profile page has their photo, Call Settings, and the image sets. An admin can change
anything for anyone. Everyone else can change only what their role allows: by default their own
profile photo and call background, and nothing else. An admin widens that on the **Roles** tab, under
**Images**, one picture at a time.

The call background can be a picture you upload or one of the pre-made backgrounds that ship with Collaborator: choose **Choose from the library** under it, filter by theme and style, and pick one. It is saved as your own picture, so you can replace or remove it like an upload.

## Participant

The Participant box is the person. It shows their camera when it is on, and the **Online** picture
when it is off. Out of the call it shows **Offline**, or nothing. **Aside** shows while they are
online but pulled into an aside elsewhere, and **Private** the same for a private conversation.

While someone speaks, a **talking border** is drawn around the box, and while their microphone is off
a **muted border** in its own color. Both share one width and fit any source size. The borders are
the only things the box ever draws; for anything more, use the Talking and Muted pictures. The
borders, their colors, the width and the **name plate** are the Stream module's settings, the same for
everyone (see [Collaborator in OBS](userguide-obs.md)).

Two more defaults shape the box while it shows a picture rather than the camera: a **color behind the
picture**, so the video area stays visible on the recording, and a **picture size** as a percentage of
the box, which leaves a margin around the picture instead of filling the height. The camera always
fills the box.

## Character

The Character box is a second box for OBS with the same pictures and its own talking and muted
borders (off by default, set for the whole environment under **Character borders**). With no Online picture and no
borders it stays transparent until the person talks or mutes, so it can sit over an existing
character bar. It carries no audio.

## The profile photo is separate

A player's own **profile photo** shows only in the app itself: the header, the call's tiles and their
profile page. It never shows in the recording, because the Online picture may be part of a matched
set of OBS pictures the owner built. The photo falls back to a plate with the player's initials and
always fills its square, cropped rather than letterboxed. The OBS pictures show exactly what was
uploaded, uncropped, since they may be transparent overlays.

## Set a picture

Images are PNG, JPEG, GIF or WebP up to 20 MB. An empty box says "not set", and the small **x** over
a box's corner clears it. Pointing at a box, or reaching it with Tab, shows the hint "Paste or click to
choose".

Every picture box in Collaborator works this way: the profile photo and call background, the
Participant and Character sets and the per-space sets on a profile, and on the Manage page the
environment icon, the sign-in background and the Default and Guest sets, and a space's picture in its
settings.

To choose a file:

1. Click the picture box, or Tab to it and press Enter or Space.
2. Pick the file.

To paste a picture you have copied, from another page, an image editor or a screenshot:

1. Copy the picture.
2. Tab to the picture box and press Ctrl+V (Cmd+V on a Mac). Or, with the mouse or on a touch
   screen, choose the small **Paste** button on the box's corner (beside the box, for the small
   environment icon). It shows when you point at the box, and always on a touch screen.
3. The browser may ask whether the page can read the clipboard. Allow it.

A pasted picture is saved exactly like a chosen file, with the same types, the same 20 MB limit and
the same messages. If it doesn't go in, the box says why:

- "No picture to paste. Copy one first." The clipboard holds text or nothing.
- "Can't read the clipboard here. Press Ctrl+V now to paste." (Cmd+V on a Mac) The browser would not
  let **Paste** read the clipboard. The picture box now has focus, so Ctrl+V pastes into it.
- "Can't read the clipboard here. Tap the picture to choose one." The same, on a touch screen.
- "That picture couldn't be read. Try choosing the file."

A box you are not allowed to change takes no paste and shows no **Paste** button. Pasting into a text
field on the same page pastes into the field as usual. Some browsers only pass **Paste** a PNG; see
[known issues](../known-issues.md). A screen reader names each box, such as "Profile picture" or
"Default Online picture", using the environment's own words.

## Per-space pictures

A space section on a member's profile has **Use Default Profile Images**. Leave it checked and the
member's defaults show in that space. Uncheck it to set pictures just for that space, so someone in two
campaigns can give each its own Character images. Any picture left unset there still falls back to
the defaults. In the call, the space list and the call's tiles show the space's Online picture (and the
Offline one for members who are not in the space) when it has been set.

## Server defaults

When neither the member nor the space has set a picture, the box shows the environment-wide **Default
Images** from the Theme tab of the Manage page. Guests show the shared **Guest images** set instead of
a member's own.
