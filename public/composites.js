// place of the modules whose parts the page draws. The person sees one Calendar, one Map; the modules behind it keep

// Pure: no document, no storage, no imports, so tools/check-canvas.mjs runs it in node. canvas.js reads the table;
// opens-with.js and layouts.js take the `aliases` map this file builds and read a stored list through it, so a
// remembered list, an Opens with or a saved layout naming `calendar`, `todo`, `maps` or `places` opens the composite,
// and nothing stored is rewritten.

// composite shows and whose being on in a space turns the composite on; `parts` are the module ids it stands in for
// there (the main included). While the main is off in a space the other parts keep their own canvas surfaces.
// `ask`: the main being on is not enough; the page asks the destination for the space first (GET
// /api/destinations/<dest>?space=<id>: the Map needs a map file, server/destinations.js `needsFile`), and the composite
// is on only where that answered. The callers below take the dest ids that answered as `shown`.
