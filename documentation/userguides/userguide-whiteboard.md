# Whiteboard

**Audience:** members, moderators and owners who draw, plan and sketch together on a space's whiteboard, and anyone who only looks at it.

The Whiteboard is a shared board for a space. Draw on it, put notes, words, shapes and pictures on it, and move them around together. Everyone in the space sees the same board, and what one person changes shows for the others as soon as it is saved. Each space has one board to begin with, and can have up to ten (see "Boards").

Everything on the board is a **block**: a note, a text block, a shape, a connector, a line, an arrow, a drawing, a highlight, a timer, a table or a picture. Most of what this guide says about blocks works the same for every kind.

**Who can:** what each role may do is set on the **Roles** tab under the Whiteboard ([Accounts, roles and permissions](userguide-accounts.md)):

- **See the whiteboard** shows the board. It starts on for members, moderators and guests.
- **Draw on the whiteboard, add pictures and change what is on it** lets you add, change, move and delete blocks. It starts on for members and moderators and off for guests.

An owner always can do both. Someone who can see the board but not change it can still look around, zoom and pick blocks; see "Who can do what" near the end.

## Set it up (owner)

1. On the Modules tab, choose **Install** beside the Whiteboard under **Available with this server**, then **Approve and enable** (see [Modules](userguide-modules.md)).
2. On the Roles tab, under the Whiteboard, choose who can **See the whiteboard** and who can **Draw on the whiteboard, add pictures and change what is on it**.

The server checks both permissions on every save, so the board's buttons are a help, not the only guard.

## Open the whiteboard

The Whiteboard is a module like the others: open it from the **Layout** menu, under **Show**, and it opens on the canvas. It works only in a space; anywhere else it says it opens in a space.

The board fills the module. The toolbar above it holds, from the left: one switch named **Tools** with **Hand**, **Select**, **Pen**, **Fill**, **Eraser**, **Text**, **Note**, **Flowchart**, **Shape**, **Table** and **Frame** (and **Select many** on touch screens only), then the **Timer** button, **Undo**, **Redo**, and, while blocks are picked, **Delete** and **Arrange**. **Pen**, **Shape** and **Flowchart** each stand for a family: **Pen** for the Pen, Marker, Brush and Highlighter; **Shape** for the Rectangle, Ellipse, Line and Arrow; **Flowchart** for the Connector and the flowchart shapes. Pick the family, then its kind on the small strip that opens under the toolbar. Each tool shows a strip of its own choices there (colours, width, text size and alignment, line style and arrowheads), and the strip keeps the tool on until you press **Escape**. At the far right of the toolbar are **Overview**, **Grid** and **Snap to grid**. When the board is narrow, the last choices of **Tools** and then the other buttons fold into the toolbar's **More** menu, and the tool you are using stays in the row. The title bar holds, after the title, the board dropdown (see "Boards"; shown to people who can change the board, and to everyone while there is more than one board), the **+**, which adds blocks, the zoom buttons, **Find** (the magnifier) and a menu with **Present**, **Present to everyone** (for people who can change the board), **Background colour…**, **Save as image…** and **Print**. The status line at the bottom says how many blocks there are, how many are selected, the zoom, and **View only** when you can look but not change the board. When the board is empty, a short line in the middle says what to do first. The board's help, read out to a screen reader, is short; this guide has the rest. The toolbar was reworked in 0.1.25 to 0.1.32; this paragraph and the sections below it were checked against the code, not by using the board, and some older sections still name the earlier toolbar.

## Draw and add blocks

Pick a tool in the toolbar, then click or drag on the board.

- **Select** (V): pick and move blocks. This is the usual tool.
- **Hand** (H): drag the board without picking or moving anything. Press **H** or **Hand** again to go back to the tool you had (see "Move the board").
- **Pen** (P): press and drag to draw. The tool stays on for the next line.
- **Note** (N): click to put a sticky note there, then type its words.
- **Text** (T): click to put words there, then type them. A text block left empty is taken away.
- **Rectangle** (R) and **Ellipse** (O): drag to draw one to size, or click for the usual size.
- **Line** (L) and **Arrow** (A): drag from one end to the other.

- **Eraser** (E): drag over drawings and highlights to remove them (see "Eraser").

A click with a tool that puts a block on the board (**Note**, **Text**, **Rectangle**, **Ellipse**, **Table** and the other insert tools) on a block that takes words edits that block, and on another block picks it, instead of placing a new block on top. Click on an empty place to put one; a click on a frame still puts the block inside it. While a drawing or insert tool is on, a small icon of the tool follows the pointer.

The **Paint** and **Flowchart** buttons open menus of more tools, and the **Timer** button puts a countdown on the board; each has its own section below: "Paint", "Flowchart and connectors", "Timer" and "Tables".

After a note, a text block, a shape, a connector, a timer or a table, the tool goes back to Select. The Pen and the other drawing tools and the Fill tool stay on for the next go. Press **Escape** to go back to Select from any tool; it works when the keyboard is on the toolbar or the title bar as well as on the board.

The **+** in the title bar puts a block in the middle of what is in sight, without choosing a tool: **Add a note**, **Add text**, **Add a rectangle**, **Add a timer** and **Add a table**. **Add a flowchart shape** opens a list of the **Rounded box**, **Diamond**, **Pill** and **Parallelogram**, and **Connect the 2 picked blocks**. The **+** also has **Add a picture** (see "Add pictures") and **Paste**. It is the way to add blocks from the keyboard.

## Paint

The **Paint** button in the toolbar opens a menu of the tools that put colour on the board. The button is on while one of them is the tool. The menu lists **Fill**, then **Pen**, **Marker**, **Brush** and **Highlighter**.

- **Fill** (F): click a block that has a background and it takes the fill colour, which starts as Yellow. A block that already has it is left alone. A line, an arrow, a connector, a drawing or a picture has no background: the pointer shows it cannot be filled, a click does nothing, and a short message says so. Hold **Alt** (**Option** on a Mac) and click a block to take its colour as the fill colour instead (its background, else its line); the board says "Fill colour:" and the colour. While Fill is the tool nothing is picked, and the strip under the toolbar shows one swatch, **Fill colour**, which you press to choose it (see "The colour strip"). Each fill is one undo step.
- **Pen** (P): a line of even width, **Medium** at first.
- **Marker** (M): a wide, round line, **Extra heavy** at first and a little see-through, so lines drawn over each other show.
- **Brush**: a line that is thinner at both ends, **Heavy** at first. With a pen or a finger on a screen that senses pressure, it is wider where you press harder. With a mouse the line is even.
- **Highlighter** (U): drag over words or shapes to lay a see-through band over them. It starts **Yellow** and **Extra heavy**. Hold **Shift** to make a straight band, across or down, whichever is the longer way. The band is a block of its own: move, copy, layer and delete it as a drawing, and double-click it to change its colour. It stays where you put it; it does not follow the words if they move.

The Pen, Marker, Brush and Highlighter stay on for the next line. A drawing and a highlight are saved when you let go. Pick the colour and width in the strip or with a right-click as for any block.

## Eraser

The **Eraser** (E) is a choice in the **Tools** switch. With it on, press and drag: a circle follows the pointer, with the Eraser's icon beside it, and every drawing (Pen, Marker or Brush) and every highlight it touches is removed. Nothing else is: notes, text, shapes, pictures, frames, connectors and locked blocks are passed over. One drag is one **Undo** step, so one **Undo** brings the whole sweep back. A single sweep removes at most 100; at the 101st the status line says "Erased 100. Lift and sweep again." and you lift and sweep again. The Eraser stays on until you press **Escape**.

## Boards

A space can hold up to ten boards, so a session's drawings do not have to share one canvas. The first board is called **Board 1** until it is renamed. The board dropdown in the title bar, after the title, shows the name of the board you are on. It is there for people who can change the board, and for everyone as soon as there is more than one board. Open it and choose a board to switch. Each board has its own blocks, background, timer and Present state, and other people's pointers show only on the board they are on. The board you used last is the one you land on, in this browser.

The menu lists the boards, the current one marked. It lists at most ten; if more exist (the rest stay stored), a grey line says "n more boards exist". People who can change the board also find **Manage boards…** in it, which opens a flyout (a drill-in with a Back row on a phone):

- **New board…** asks for a name (up to 40 characters, not the same as another board's) and opens the new board. At ten boards it is off, with "10 boards at most".
- **Rename board…** renames the board you are on.
- **Delete board…** asks first ("Board "<name>" and its N blocks go to Deleted boards for 7 days."). The last board cannot be deleted; the entry is off and says "The last board stays".
- **Deleted boards…** lists the boards in the trash with the days left, and the count beside it; choose one to restore it. After 7 days a deleted board is removed for good, the next time someone who can change the board has the page open.

**Save as image** names the file after the board. The dropdown is the host's own menu, so it looks and moves like the title bar's other menus. Before 0.1.60 the boards were tabs in the toolbar; they are not any more.

If your connection or the server fails while you change a board, your unsent changes are kept in your browser, also if you reload or close the tab, and sent again when the page opens (for up to 10 minutes after the first try). Refused-for-now answers are tried again after 2, 5, 15 and 60 seconds. A very large **Undo** can take about two minutes to reach the server; it is kept in the browser meanwhile. The limits that are the page's own are in [known-issues](../known-issues.md).

## Flowchart and connectors

The **Flowchart** button opens a menu with the **Connector**, then the **Rectangle**, **Rounded box**, **Diamond**, **Pill** and **Parallelogram**, then the **Table** and the **Frame**. The button is on while one of them is the tool. The shapes are made as the Rectangle is: drag to size, or click for the usual size. They hold words as a rectangle does. Use the Rounded box for a step, the Diamond for a choice, the Pill for a start or an end, and the Parallelogram for what goes in or out.

A **connector** joins two blocks and follows them when they move or change size.

1. Pick **Connector** (C) in the Flowchart menu. Blocks show their connection points when the pointer is over them.
2. Press on a block and drag to another block, or to the empty board for a free end, and let go. Press near the middle of a side to use that side; anywhere else on the block, the connector uses the side that faces the other end.

The connector is made, picked, and the tool goes back to Select. A click with no drag makes nothing.

You can also pick two blocks and choose **Connect the 2 picked blocks** in the **+** (under **Add a flowchart shape**), or **Connect them** in the right-click menu. It joins the first you picked to the second.

- Only a block with a box of its own (a note, a text block, a shape, a table, a timer or a picture) can have a connector on it, not a line, a drawing or another connector.
- Pick a connector and drag either end to attach it somewhere else: onto a block, or to the board for a free end.
- Double-click a connector, or press **Enter** on it, to give it a label of a few words, on one line.
- A connector has a **Line** colour and a width, set as for any line: **Thin** and Ink at first. Its line style and arrowheads are in the **Line style and arrowheads** button in the toolbar (see below).
- A connector goes round only its own two blocks, not other blocks in the way.
- Deleting a block deletes the connectors on it, in the same step: one **Undo** brings back the block and then its connectors. If someone else deletes a block, its connectors go from your board too.
- Copying blocks takes the connectors between them along. A copied connector with an end on a block that was not copied keeps that end as a free point, where it is drawn.

### Line style and arrowheads

The **Line style and arrowheads** button opens a menu for the picked connectors, or for new connectors when none is picked. It is there only if you may use the Connector.

- **Line style**: **Elbow** (straight runs with right-angled bends, the usual) or **Straight**.
- **Arrowheads**: **None**, **End**, **Start** or **Both**. **End** is the usual.

With several connectors picked that differ, no choice is marked. If you have blocks picked and none is a connector, the menu says "Pick a connector to change its line style". A choice made on picked connectors is also kept for the new ones, while the page is open.

## Timer

The **Timer** button in the toolbar (Y) is a tool: pick it, then click the board to put a countdown there, centred on the click. **Add a timer** in the **+** puts one in the middle of what is in sight. It is five minutes at first. The tool goes back to Select once the timer is there, and pressing the button or **Y** again, before you click, goes back to the tool you had.

The face shows the time left and a ring that empties. Its buttons, on the block, are:

- **Start**, which becomes **Pause** while it runs, **Go on** after a pause and **Start again** after it ran out.
- **Reset**, which puts the full length back.
- **Length**, which opens a menu: 1 min, 2 min, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min and 30 min, **Custom…** (minutes and seconds, from 1 second to 23:59:59) and **Mute the sound**.

Choosing a new length stops the timer and resets it. Only someone who may change the board sees the buttons; everyone sees the time.

Everyone in the space sees the same time left, because each page counts from the time the server gave when the timer was started. Nothing is saved while it runs: Start, Pause, Reset and a new length are one save each. When it reaches zero the face says "Time is up" and pulses gently (it holds still if your device asks for less motion), and a short soft tone plays. A screen reader is told when it starts, pauses and ends, but not each second.

- **Mute the sound** is yours alone and your browser keeps it. The tone also plays only after you have pressed or typed on the page once, because browsers do not allow a sound before that.
- A timer that ended more than 10 seconds before your page saw it does not sound.
- A copy of a timer is never running: it has the same length and has not started.
- A timer is a block: move it, resize it from a corner, give it colours, layer it and delete it.

## Tables

A table is a grid of cells, each holding words. It has 3 columns and 3 rows at first, and its first row is a header, with its own light background and bold words.

1. Pick **Table** (G) in the **Flowchart** menu, or choose **Add a table** in the **+**.
2. Click the board for a table centred there, or drag to give it a size. The columns share the width and the rows the height.
3. Type the first cell's words. The table is saved when you finish that cell, even if it is empty.

Write in a cell:

- Double-click a cell to edit it. The same formatting bar as for a note's words is over it (see "Write words").
- **Tab** keeps the words and goes to the next cell; **Shift+Tab** goes to the one before. **Tab** in the last cell adds a row first, up to the limit. **Enter** keeps the words and goes down a cell; **Shift+Enter** starts a new line in the cell. Click elsewhere to keep the words and stop.
- **Escape** puts back the words of the cell you are editing, as they were when you began it. It does not undo cells you already kept; those are separate steps for **Undo**.
- With a table picked, a click on a cell makes that cell the active one, and so does finishing an edit. Then the arrow keys move from cell to cell instead of moving the table, **Enter** or **F2** edits the cell, a letter you type starts its words afresh, **Delete** empties it and **Escape** goes back to moving the table with the arrow keys. **Enter** on a picked table with no active cell edits the cell last pressed, or the first. A screen reader is told the row, the column and the words.

Change its shape:

- With the table picked, a grab bar sits on each line between two columns and between two rows; drag one to change that column or row. A **+** below the last row and one beside the last column add a row or a column.
- Drag a corner to scale the whole table. A row is always as tall as its words need, and at least a set height.
- Right-click a cell for **Edit cell**, **Rows and columns** (**Insert row above**, **Insert row below**, **Insert column left**, **Insert column right**, **Delete row**, **Delete column**), **Header row** (on or off) and **Cell** (**Clear cell**, **Copy cell text**, **Cut cell text**, **Paste cell text**). The last row or column cannot be deleted.
- A table's colours are its **Lines** (the grid and the outer border, Ink at first, or **None**), its **Background** (none at first) and its **Words**. The text size and alignment of the whole table are set with **Text size and alignment** (small and left at first).

Paste rows from a spreadsheet (Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers) with **Ctrl+V** (**Cmd+V**) and they become a table, where the pointer is over the board or in the middle of what is in sight. Only the words are taken, not the spreadsheet's look. A table holds at most 20 columns, 50 rows and 500 characters in a cell, and its cells together are limited too. What does not fit is left out, and a message says "Only part of it was pasted". When the table is full, the words of the cell you edit are cut short, with a message.

Changing a table while someone else changes the same table: the cell you edit is written into the newest table, so cells they changed stay. If the row or column you were in is gone, the words are not kept and the board says so. Two people changing the same cell at once still lose one change, as for any block.

## Grid

The **Grid** button (a small table of cells, at the right of the toolbar) opens a panel for how the board's grid looks. It is your own choice: your browser keeps it, other people do not see it, and it is not in the board's data.

- **Style:** dots (the usual), lines (graph paper) or off.
- **Size:** the space between grid points, from 8 to 96 pixels (24 at first). Snap to grid uses the same size.
- **Colour:** **Automatic**, **Muted**, **Accent** or one of the tints.
- **Opacity:** how strong it draws.

The panel stays open while you click inside it and closes when you click outside or press **Escape**.

## Snap to grid

The board shows a grid (dots at first; see "Grid"). **Snap to grid** in the toolbar (the grid button, at the far right of the row) puts blocks on those dots as you make, move or resize them:

- A new note or text block lands with its corner on a dot. A shape or a table you drag has its corners on dots, and a line or an arrow its ends. So does a block added with the **+**.
- A connector's free end, made or moved, lands on a dot. An end on a block follows the block.
- A note's pointer tip you drag lands on a dot.
- When you drag blocks, the block you hold lands with its corner on a dot, and the others picked with it move by the same amount.
- When you resize a block, the edges you drag land on dots, and so does the end of a line you drag. A resize that keeps the block's shape (with **Shift** held, or a picture) does not snap.
- A pen drawing never snaps. Pasting, duplicating and the arrow keys do not snap.

Hold **Alt** (**Option** on a Mac) while you drag or click to do the opposite for that one gesture: place a block freely while Snap to grid is on, or snap it while it is off.

Snap to grid is off at first. It is your own choice, not the board's: your browser keeps it for next time, and other people do not see it. Only someone who may change the board has the button.

## Background colour

The whole board has one background colour, the same for everyone. Anyone who can change the board can change it.

1. Right-click an empty place on the board, or open the title bar's menu.
2. Choose **Background colour**, then a colour.
3. The board asks you to confirm the change. Confirm to make it.

The choices are in groups:

- **Default** is the theme's own board colour.
- **Custom background** is a row that is switched off for now, until the page has a colour picker.
- **Light backgrounds** and **Dark backgrounds** are fixed colours. They look the same in light and dark mode.
- **Tinted backgrounds** are light washes of the tints and of **Ink**. They follow the theme, so blocks stay readable on them.

The one in use is marked. A change is one **Undo** step. If someone else changed the background after you, **Undo** leaves it and says so.

Blocks keep their own colours on a fixed background. A block's colour menu has the same **Light**, **Dark** and **Tinted** groups for its border, background and words. A block can also have a fixed colour that stays the same in both modes.

## Pick, move and change blocks

With Select:

- Click a block to pick it, and drag it to move it. It is saved once, where you drop it.
- Drag a corner handle to change its size. Hold **Shift** to keep its shape. A text block's corner changes only its width; its words set its height. Drag either end of a line, an arrow or a connector to move that end. A drawing and a highlight have no handles.
- Double-click a note, a text block, a shape or a table cell to change its words, and a connector to change its label. Double-click a line, an arrow, a drawing or a highlight to change its colour.
- Right-click a block (or press it long on a touch screen) for what you can do with it: **Edit** (**Describe** for a picture), **Add pointer** or **Remove pointer** for a note, the table's cell rows (see "Tables"), **Colour**, **Line width**, **Text size** and **Align** for blocks with words, **Connect them** when two blocks are picked, **Open link** for links in the words, the four **Layer** moves, **Cut**, **Copy**, **Paste**, **Duplicate**, **Save as image…** and **Delete**.
- **Delete** or **Backspace**, or the bin button in the toolbar, deletes what is picked.

From the keyboard: **Tab** goes to the board and then to each block in turn, and the block it reaches is picked. **Enter** edits the picked block. The arrow keys move it 10 board units a press, or 1 with **Shift**; a run of presses is saved once, after the last one.

## Align and distribute

With two or more blocks picked, **Arrange** in the toolbar (it appears beside the bin) and **Arrange** in the right-click menu offer:

- **Align left**, **Align centre**, **Align right**, **Align top**, **Align middle** and **Align bottom**, which line the picked blocks up to the box round all of them (two or more blocks).
- **Distribute horizontally** and **Distribute vertically**, which space the blocks evenly between the first and the last (three or more blocks).

Each is one **Undo** step. A connector is not moved; it follows its blocks. Locked blocks are left where they are, and the board says "Left a locked block as it is."

**Guides.** While you drag blocks with **Snap to grid** off, a line shows when the box you hold lines up with the edge or middle of a block near it, and the box lands on it. Hold **Alt** (**Option** on a Mac) to drag without guides. With **Snap to grid** on, the grid wins and there are no guides.

## Lock a block

A locked block stays as it is. Pick blocks and choose **Lock** in the right-click menu, or press **Ctrl+L** (**Cmd+L**); choose **Unlock** or press the key again to undo it. A small padlock shows at the block's corner.

- A locked block cannot be moved, resized, deleted, recoloured, moved to another layer or edited. It can still be picked, copied, duplicated and saved as an image.
- Anyone who may change the board may lock or unlock any block. It is saved with the block (`locked`).
- **Align**, **Distribute**, **Delete** and **Undo** leave locked blocks as they are and say so.

## Group blocks

Pick two or more blocks and choose **Group** in the right-click menu, or press **Ctrl+G** (**Cmd+G**), so they move together. **Ungroup**, or **Ctrl+Shift+G** (**Cmd+Shift+G**), breaks the group up.

- Picking one block of a group picks the whole group.
- A copy or a duplicate of a group is a new group of its own. A block copied without the rest of its group is in no group.
- **Resizing a group as one picked selection is not built.**

## Frames and Present

A **frame** is a titled area that holds blocks, such as a slide or a step. Frames sit under all other blocks.

**Add one:** choose **Frame** (**S**) in the **Flowchart** menu and drag to size, or click for the usual size; or choose **Add a frame** in the **+**. Its title opens for editing. Type it and press Enter.

- **Pick a frame** by its title tab or its border (about 8 pixels wide, wider on a touch screen). The empty inside is not the frame: a press there picks what is under it or starts a rectangle.
- **Rename:** double-click the title tab, press **Enter** on a picked frame, or choose **Rename** in its menu. A title is one line of up to 80 characters. A frame is at least 80 by 60 board units.
- **Moving a frame** (dragging, the arrow keys, align or distribute) moves the blocks fully inside it with it, as one **Undo** step. Locked blocks stay and the board says "Left a locked block as it is." A frame inside a frame goes with it.
- **Copy, cut and duplicate** a frame take the blocks inside it. **Delete** and **resize** change only the frame.
- Connectors do not join a frame.
- **Save frame as image…** in a picked frame's menu saves a PNG exactly the frame's size, with everything that overlaps it and without its title tab. It has the same **Background** and **Size** choices as **Save as image**.

**Present** shows the frames one at a time, each fitted to the board and lit, with the rest of the board dimmed. Choose **Present** in the title bar's menu or the board's right-click menu, **Present from this frame** in a frame's menu, or the **Present** (play) button in the toolbar's frame choices.

- Frames go top to bottom and, within a row, left to right. A row is the frames whose tops are within half the first frame's height.
- A bar at the bottom has **Back**, **Restart** (to the first frame), **Jump to Frame** (a list of the frames to pick from), a count such as "2 of 5", **Next** and **Exit**. It also has a slider that sets how far the rest of the board is dimmed (up to full black; your own choice, kept in your browser), a button for how it moves between frames, **Notes**, and, if you may change the board, **Present to everyone**.
- **How it moves** is **Immediate**, **Fade** or **Pan**. The one you choose is used (Pan at first). If your system asks for less motion, a change you did not choose jumps, and one you chose still animates.
- Keys: the right and down arrows, **Page Down** and **Space** go on; the left and up arrows and **Page Up** go back; **Home** and **End** go to the first and last; **Escape** exits. A screen reader hears "Frame 2 of 5: Plan".
- While presenting, the board cannot be changed, and the wheel, a pinch, a drag and the zoom buttons are ignored. **Exit** puts back the view you had. Find is off.
- With no frames it says "No frames to present. Add a frame first."

**Present to everyone** makes the people on the board follow you. Anyone who can change the board can start it, and only one person presents at a time; if two start together, the first wins and the other follows. Followers see the same frame, the same move and the same dimming, with a line naming who is presenting, and can only **Exit**. A follower who leaves can choose **Rejoin <name>'s presentation** in the title bar's menu. Another person who can change the board can use **Take over**, after a question. When the presenter stops, or their page is gone for about 35 seconds, the others are told and go back to the board. Someone who can only look can follow but not present to everyone. The presentation is kept in the module's stored data, not sent as live messages.

### Speaker notes

A frame can have notes: words for the presenter that are never drawn on the board.

1. Pick a frame and choose **Notes** (the speech-bubble button on the strip for frames), or choose the notes mark in the frame's title tab.
2. Type the notes. People who can change the board write; others read.

While you present, **Notes** in the bar shows a box with the current frame's notes (or "No notes for this frame."). The box shows on your screen only, and it can be moved. A follower never has it. (Moving it and keeping it inside the board were read from the code, not tried.) Notes are part of the board's stored data, so anyone who can open the board can read them. The box says: "Anyone who can open this board can read notes. Don't put secrets in them."

## Write words

While you edit words, a box sits over the block. **Enter** starts a new line. Click elsewhere, or press **Ctrl+Enter** (**Cmd+Enter** on a Mac), to keep what you typed. **Escape** puts the words back as they were. A connector's label and a picture's description are one line, where **Enter** keeps them.

The words of a note, a text block, a shape and a table cell take formatting. A small bar of buttons sits just above the block (below it when there is no room above), and it follows the words you select:

- **Bold**, **Italic** and **Code**, also with **Ctrl+B**, **Ctrl+I** and **Ctrl+E** (**Cmd** on a Mac). Press again to take the mark off. With nothing selected, a pair of marks is put down with the caret between them.
- **Bulleted list** and **Numbered list**, on each line the selection touches.
- **Heading**, which steps through a large, a medium and a small heading, then none. It tells you the level.
- **Link** (**Ctrl+K**, **Cmd+K**): the bar asks for an address. **Enter** or the tick puts the link round the selected words; **Escape** or the cross goes back to the words. Only a web address (http or https) can be a link. An address with no `https://` is taken as https.

The words are saved once, when you stop editing, and **Undo** takes back the whole edit, not each button press. A press on the bar keeps the box open.

A link in the words opens in a new tab with **Ctrl+click** (**Cmd+click**) on it, or a plain click on a block that is already the only one picked. With a touch screen, tap a link once its block is picked. A link is never followed by a plain click on a block that is not picked yet; that picks and moves the block. The right-click menu has **Open link** for up to three links in the block's words; it is the way to open one from the keyboard.

### Text size and alignment

The **Text size and alignment** button in the toolbar sets the words of the picked notes, text blocks, shapes and tables. Under **Text size**: **Small**, **Medium**, **Large** and **Huge**. Under **Align**: **Left**, **Centre** and **Right**. The same two lists are **Text size** and **Align** in the right-click menu.

- With nothing picked, it sets the size and alignment for the new blocks you make, and **Default** puts back each kind's own. A size or alignment picked on blocks is also kept for new blocks while the page is open.
- With picked blocks that differ, no choice is marked. If the picked blocks have no words to change, the menu says "Pick a note, text, shape or table to change its words".
- The default is Large and left for a text block, and Small and left for a table.

## Note pointer

A note can have a pointer: a tail to a tip, to point at something on the board.

1. Right-click the note and choose **Add pointer**. A tail appears below it.
2. Pick the note. The tip has a handle: drag it to where the note should point. It is saved once, where you let go.

The pointer is part of the note: it has the note's fill, border and shadow, and it goes where the note goes, so the tip keeps its place relative to the note. It always stays outside the note, between 12 and 800 board units away. If you make the note bigger over the tip, the tip is pushed out past the nearest side. A corner handle changes the note's body only. Choose **Remove pointer** in the right-click menu to take it away. With Snap to grid, the tip lands on a dot. A copy of the note keeps its pointer. A screen reader is not told a pointer is there.

## Colours and widths

A block has up to three colours, each set on its own: its **Border** (for a line or a drawing, its **Line**), its **Background** and its **Words**. The colours are **Ink** (the theme's text colour), **Yellow**, **Orange**, **Red**, **Pink**, **Purple**, **Blue**, **Teal** and **Green**. They follow the theme, in light and dark mode. Some colours also offer **None** (not drawn), and a note's border offers **Matching** (a little darker than its background). A connector's border is its **Line**, a table's is its **Lines**, and a highlight has one **Colour**; a highlight starts Yellow.

A line or a border has a width: **Hairline**, **Thin**, **Medium**, **Thick**, **Heavy** or **Extra heavy**. Each choice in the menu shows a sample line.

- Right-click a block and choose **Colour** or **Line width** to change it, and every other picked block with it.
- With nothing picked, a colour or a width you choose is for the new blocks you make. **Default** puts back each kind's own colour or width.

A colour picked on blocks is also kept for the new blocks you make, where their kind takes it, as long as the page is open, and so is a width picked on one line, arrow, drawing or shape. When the picked blocks differ, no choice is marked.

### The colour strip

The strip under the left end of the toolbar has a swatch for **Border**, one for **Background** and one for **Words**, and a short line for the **Line width**. Each shows the value now, and its tooltip names it, such as "Background: Yellow". Press one to open its own menu.

- With blocks picked, the strip shows their colours and width, and its menus change them.
- With nothing picked, it shows what new blocks get from the tool you have, and its menus set that. With the Fill tool it shows one swatch, **Fill colour**.

What a swatch can say:

- **Mixed**: the picked blocks differ. The swatch shows several colours.
- **None**: that colour is not drawn.
- **Matching**: a note's border, a little darker than its background.
- **Default**: each kind of block keeps its own colour or width. With a tool picked, the tooltip names that kind's own, such as "Background: Default (Yellow)"; with Select, the swatch is drawn dashed.

A swatch is hidden when the picked blocks, or the blocks the tool makes, do not have that colour or a width that can be set here. The strip is not shown to someone who may only look.

The strip lets presses through: a click on the board beside its buttons reaches the board and the blocks under it.

## Layers

Blocks lie on top of each other. Right-click a block and choose, under **Layer**: **Bring to front**, **Forward one layer**, **Back one layer** or **Send to back**. Forward and back step past the next block that overlaps it. A choice that would change nothing is greyed out.

## Zoom

The zoom goes from 20% to 400%, and the status line shows it. On a touch screen, pinch to zoom. With a mouse, hold **Ctrl** (**Cmd** on a Mac) and turn the wheel; each notch zooms at most 12%. A pinch on a trackpad zooms too. The keys are **+** (or **=**) to zoom in, **-** to zoom out and **0** to show everything.

The zoom buttons are in the title bar: **Zoom out**, **Zoom in**, and the magnifier, whose menu has **Zoom in**, **Zoom out**, **Show everything** and **Actual size**. **Show everything** fits the whole board in sight, but never zooms in past 100%. **Actual size** goes back to 100%.

## Find

Choose **Find** in the title bar's menu, or press **/** while the board has the keyboard and no block is being edited. A bar opens at the top right of the board. Type the words to look for.

- It searches the words in notes, text blocks and shapes, frame titles, table cells, connector labels and picture descriptions. It ignores capital letters and accents, so "cafe" finds "Café".
- The bar says "2 of 7", or "No matches". **Enter** or **Next** goes to the next match and **Shift+Enter** or **Previous** to the one before; both wrap round at the ends.
- Every match is outlined, and the current one more strongly. If the current match is out of sight the view glides to it; it never zooms in. What you had picked stays picked.
- **Escape** or **Close** shuts the bar and gives the keyboard back to the board. Inside a note or a table cell that you are editing, **/** types a slash as usual.
- A screen reader hears "Match 2 of 7:" and the words found.
- Find is off while you present. Someone who may only look can use it.

## Overview

**Show overview** in the title bar's menu puts a small map of the whole board at the bottom right: every block as a small box, frames as outlines, and the part you are looking at as a rectangle in the accent colour. Click or tap the map to put the middle of your view there, at the same zoom, or drag the rectangle to move the view. **Hide overview** takes it away.

- It is 160 by 110 pixels, or 120 by 84 on a narrow screen (under 520 pixels).
- It is off at first. Your choice is your own: your browser keeps it for next time, and other people and the board's data do not see it.
- It is hidden while you present, when the board is empty, and when the module is smaller than 360 by 320 pixels.
- Someone who may only look can use it.

## Select several blocks

- **Shift-click**, **Ctrl-click** or **Cmd-click** a block to add it to what is picked, or to take it out.
- Drag on an empty part of the board to draw a rectangle: every block it touches is picked. With **Shift**, **Ctrl** or **Cmd** held, they are added to what is picked.
- **Ctrl+A** (**Cmd+A**) picks every block. **Select all** is also in the right-click menu of the empty board.
- **Escape** picks nothing.

Drag any picked block and they all move together. Colour, Line width, Layer, Delete and the arrow keys work on every picked block you may change. The status line says how many are selected.

On a touch screen, one finger on the empty board moves the board. Turn on **Select many** in the toolbar (touch screens only) to drag a rectangle instead, and to add or take out a block with a tap.

## Copy, cut, paste and duplicate

- **Ctrl+C** copies the picked blocks, **Ctrl+X** cuts them and **Ctrl+V** pastes them (**Cmd** on a Mac). **Ctrl+D** (**Cmd+D**) duplicates them at once.
- The same four are in a block's right-click menu, and **Paste** is in the **+**. On the empty board, **Paste here** pastes where you right-clicked.
- Each paste lands a step down and to the right of the last one, so copies never hide each other. After a cut, the first paste lands where the blocks were.
- The copies are new blocks, yours, on top of the others, and are picked once they are there.

The copied blocks are kept by this page only. They go when you close or reload the page, and you cannot paste them into another tab or another space.

Copying or cutting blocks with the keys also replaces what was on your computer's clipboard, so a picture you copied elsewhere before is no longer there to paste.

If you copy blocks here with the keys and then copy words in another program, pressing **Ctrl+V** (**Cmd+V**) on the board does nothing. It does not put the copied blocks down, and it does not forget them either: **Paste** in the menus still puts them down. A picture copied in another program is added as a picture.

## Undo and redo

**Undo** and **Redo** are in the toolbar. **Ctrl+Z** undoes; **Ctrl+Shift+Z** or **Ctrl+Y** redoes (**Cmd** on a Mac).

- They undo only your own changes, never someone else's.
- One gesture is one step: a drag, a stroke, a resize, a colour, a paste, a delete of several blocks. A run of arrow-key presses is one step. Several pictures added at once (one drop, one paste, one choice in the **+**) are one step too, however long they take to arrive.
- Undo puts back only what your step changed. If someone else has changed the same thing since, their change stays. A block someone else deleted is left out: "Left out a block someone else deleted."
- Some parts of a block go together: a line's two ends, the place and size of a note, a shape or a picture, a drawing's place and its line, a text block's place and width. If someone else has changed any of such a part since, undo leaves that whole part as they left it, so it never makes a shape neither of you made. When nothing your step changed can be put back, the board says "Left a block as it is: someone else changed it since."
- The board keeps your last 100 steps, for as long as the page is open. Reloading the page, or the whole board being cleared or put back, empties the list.

## Move the board

With any tool:

- Hold the **spacebar** and drag.
- Drag with the middle mouse button.
- Turn the mouse wheel, or scroll with two fingers on a trackpad.
- On a touch screen, drag with one finger on the empty board, or with two fingers anywhere.

Or pick **Hand** (H) in the **Tools** switch and drag anywhere, over blocks too; nothing is picked or moved. Press **H** or the Hand button again to go back to the tool you had.

### Drag with the right mouse button

Drag with the right mouse button to move the board, on the empty board or over a block. The block stays where it is and is not picked. A right-click that does not move opens the menu as before. A right-click straight after a right-drag opens its menu too.

## Add pictures

Put a picture from your computer on the board in one of three ways:

- Paste it (**Ctrl+V** or **Cmd+V**) after copying it elsewhere. It goes where the pointer is over the board, or in the middle of what is in sight.
- Drag picture files onto the board. "Drop to add to the board" shows while you drag, and the pictures land where you let go.
- Choose **Add a picture** in the **+** and pick files.

The board takes JPEG, PNG, WebP and GIF pictures (a GIF becomes a still picture of its first frame). Other files are left out with "Only pictures can go on the board." Each picture is made smaller in your browser first, to about 2000 pixels on its long edge, and is sent one at a time; a placeholder shows where it will be, and the status line says how many are on their way. Several pictures land a step apart and are picked together, and are one undo step.

- A picture is a block: move it, resize it from a corner (it always keeps its shape), give it a border, layer it, copy it.
- Double-click it, press **Enter**, or choose **Describe** in its right-click menu, to give it a short description (one line, up to 300 characters). A screen reader reads it, and it shows as the tooltip.
- Everyone who can see the board sees the pictures.
- Deleting a picture block does not delete the picture's file: an undo brings it back. See "Limits".

The server takes up to 30 pictures a minute from one person; each picture counts once. Past that, the board says "Adding a lot of pictures at once. The rest follow in a few seconds." and carries on.

## Save as image and print

Anyone who can see the board can save it as a picture or print it. Nothing on the board changes.

**Save as image:**

1. Open the title bar's menu and choose **Save as image…**, or right-click the board or a block and choose it there.
2. Under **What to save**, choose **Everything**, **What is selected** or **What is in sight**. **What is selected** is off until something is picked; it takes the connectors between the picked blocks too.
3. Choose the **Background**: **Board colour** or **Transparent**.
4. Choose the **Size**: **Normal (1x)** or **Double (2x)**. The window says the picture's size in pixels, and says when it is made smaller to fit.
5. Choose **Save**. A PNG file named for the board and the date and time, such as "Board 1 2026-11-09 1432.png", goes to your computer, and the board says so.

The picture shows what the board shows, in the colours you see now. The selection frame, handles, connection points and any open text box are left out. A picture block that cannot be loaded is drawn as "Picture not found". There is no SVG file and no way yet to save the picture to the Vault. If there is nothing to save, the window says "There is nothing on the board to save." (or "Select what to save first.", "There is nothing in sight to save.").

**Print:** choose **Print** in the title bar's menu. It prints the whole board, fitted to the paper, without the title bar, toolbar or status line, in the light colours. If the board is empty it says "There is nothing on the board to print." **Ctrl+P** (**Cmd+P**) is the browser's own and does not do this; it prints the page as the browser sees it.

## Other people's pointers

While another person moves their pointer over the board, you see it: an arrow in their colour with their name, and what tool they are using. It is the same colour for a person everywhere. Pointers are sent as live messages, not saved: they are not in the board's data, they fade after 5 seconds without a word, and go after 20. They need nothing from the call, so they work with no voice or video. At most 50 are drawn. Your own choice to hide them is kept in your browser. Read from the code; not tried with several people.

## When other people change the board

Each block is saved on its own, so two people changing different blocks never get in each other's way. A block is saved whole when you let go of it, and the others see it then; they do not see a drag or a stroke while it goes on. If two people change the same block at the same moment, the last save wins. While you are moving or editing a block, a change to it from someone else waits until you let it go.

If your connection drops and comes back, the board reads itself again and takes in what it missed, without touching what you are doing. A block you are editing, dragging or have not yet saved is left alone. Read from the code (0.1.47 to 0.1.49); not tried with a real dropped connection.

If the server asks the board to slow down, it says "Saving a lot at once. The rest is saved in a few seconds." and carries on. A change the server refuses is put back, with "You may not change this whiteboard." or the server's reason.

## Limits

- Up to ten boards for each space, each name up to 40 characters; a deleted board is kept 7 days.
- A block can be at most 60 KB as it is saved. A long drawing is thinned to fit.
- **Stored board data: 5 MB in all.** Everything the Whiteboard saves (the blocks of every space's board together) can be at most 5 MB: that limit is for the whole module, not each space. Pictures are kept apart and do not count toward it. Past it, a change is refused with the server's reason.
- The words of a note, a text block or a shape can be at most 4000 characters, and a picture's description one line of at most 300.
- A table has at most 20 columns, 50 rows and 500 characters in a cell, and all its cells together fit in about 48,000 stored characters. A column is 60 to 800 board units wide.
- A timer runs from 1 second to 23 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds.
- A note's pointer tip is 12 to 800 board units from the note.
- Save as image: a picture is at most 16,384 pixels on a side and about 67 million pixels in all; a larger one is made smaller and the window says so.
- A block can be at most 4000 board units wide or tall.
- The server takes up to 240 saves a minute from one person; past that the board waits and carries on.
- Undo keeps your last 100 steps, on this page only.
- **Pictures: 5 MB for each picture file**, a separate limit from the stored board data above. Your browser makes each picture smaller first (about 2000 pixels on its long edge) and the server takes a file of at most 5 MB. JPEG, PNG, WebP and GIF are accepted. The server also refuses a picture whose pixel size is very large. A space can keep at most 500 picture files. A picture's file stays when its block is deleted, and still counts toward the 500. The server takes up to 30 pictures a minute from one person.
